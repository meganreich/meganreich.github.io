              H) of the larval stages without influence of adult diet. Here, we test this assumption by conducting laboratory feeding experiments for monarch butterflies (
              Danaus plexippus
              ) including: (1) a starvation treatment where adults were not fed and (2) an enriched treatment where adults were fed a diet isotopically enriched in deuterium ({\textasciitilde} +78‰) compared to the larval diet. The

              2
              H values of adult wings were measured at different time steps along the 24-day experiment. We also investigated intra-wing differences in
              δ
              2
              H values caused by wing pigmentation, absence of wing scales, and presence of major wing veins. We conclude that, although the magnitude of the changes in

              H values are small ({\textasciitilde}6‰), wing
              δ
              2
              H values vary based on adult diet and insect age, particularly early after eclosion (i.e., 1–4 days). We found that wing shade, wing pigmentation, and the presence of wing scales do not alter wing
              δ
              2
              H values. However, wing samples containing veins had systematically higher
              δ
              2
              H values ({\textasciitilde}9‰), suggesting that adult diet influences the hemolymph that circulates in the wing veins. We hypothesise that there is a stronger influence of adult diet on the isotope signal of wings during early adult life relative to later life because of increased metabolic and physiologic activity in young insect wings. We argue that the influence of the isotopic contribution of adult diet is generally small and is likely minimal if the wings are carefully sampled to avoid veins. However, we also demonstrated that wings are not inert tissues, and that adult feeding contributes to some of the intra-population
              δ
              2
              H variance. We conclude that
              δ
              2
              H geolocation using insect wings remains valid, but that adult feeding, butterfly age and wing vein sampling generate an inherent uncertainty limiting the precision of geolocation.},

	abstract = {Eastern spruce budworm moth (
              Choristoneura fumiferana
              (Clem.)) mass outbreaks have widespread economic and ecological consequences. A key explanation for the large-scale spread and synchronization of these outbreaks is the long-distance dispersal (up to 450 km) of moths from hotspots (high-density populations) to lower-density areas. These events have proved difficult to monitor because dispersal flights occur only a few times a year, have no consistent routes, and commonly used tracking methods (e.g., population genetics, mark-recapture, radio telemetry) are inadequate for this system. Confirming immigration and distinguishing between local and immigrant individuals are crucial steps in identifying the physical and ecological drivers of moth dispersal. Here, we test whether isotopes of hydrogen (i.e., delta notation:
              δ
              2
              H) and strontium (i.e., strontium isotope ratios:

              Sr/
              86
              Sr), known to independently vary in space in a predictable manner, can be used to show that an immigration event occurred and to distinguish between local and immigrant adult spruce budworm moths. We used an automated pheromone trap system to collect individuals at six different sites in eastern Canada within and outside the current outbreak area of budworm moths. We first use moth flight behavior and time of capture, currently the best available tool, to determine putative local vs. immigrant status, and then evaluate whether individual

              2
              H differ between putative classes. At two sites, we detect immigrant individuals that differ significantly from putative locals and thus confirm immigration has occurred. Saliently, sites where putative locals were sampled before the occurrence of potential immigration events ({\textasciitilde}10 days) showed the strongest differences between immigrant individuals’ and local

              H values. Sites where the collection of putative locals was close in time (hours) or following an immigration event (days) had a less-clear distinction between putative immigrants and locals, and showed signs of mixing between these two groups. We speculate that recent immigration could have led to the misclassification of immigrants as putative locals.

              H data generally support the adequacy of current approaches using capture-time to detect immigration events, and provide enhanced resolution to distinguish between local and immigrant individuals and to confirm an immigration event. We discuss the broader implication of adding isotopes to the toolkit to monitor spruce budworm dispersal and suggest next steps in implementing these tools.},

	abstract = {Migratory insects are key players in ecosystem functioning and services, but their spatiotemporal distributions are typically poorly known. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) may be used to predict species seasonal distributions, but the resulting hypotheses should eventually be validated by field data. The painted lady butterfly (
              Vanessa cardui
              ) performs multigenerational migrations between Europe and Africa and has become a model species for insect movement ecology. While the annual migration cycle of this species is well understood for Europe and northernmost Africa, it is still unknown where most individuals spend the winter. Through ENM, we previously predicted suitable breeding grounds in the subhumid regions near the tropics between November and February. In this work, we assess the suitability of these predictions through i) extensive field surveys and ii) two-year monitoring in six countries: a large-scale monitoring scheme to study butterfly migration in Africa. We document new breeding locations, year-round phenological information, and hostplant use. Field observations were nearly always predicted with high probability by the previous ENM, and monitoring demonstrated the influence of the precipitation seasonality regime on migratory phenology. Using the updated dataset, we built a refined ENM for the Palearctic-African range of
              V. cardui
              . We confirm the relevance of the Afrotropical region and document the missing natural history pieces of the longest migratory cycle described in butterflies.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Many insect species undertake multi-generational migrations in the Afro-tropical and Palearctic ranges, and understanding their migratory connectivity remains challenging due to their small size, short life span and large population sizes. Hydrogen isotope ( δ 2H) can be used to reconstruct the movement of dispersing or migrating insects, but applying δ 2H for provenance requires a robust isotope baseline map (i.e., isoscape) for the Afro-Palearctic. Methods: We analysed the δ 2H in the wings ( δ 2H wing) of 142 resident butterﬂies from 56 sites across the Afro-Palearctic. The δ 2H wing values were compared to the predicted local growing-season precipitation δ 2H values ( δ 2H GSP) using a linear regression model to develop an insect wing δ 2H isoscape. We used multivariate linear mixed models and high-resolution and time-speciﬁc remote sensing climate and environmental data to explore the controls of the residual δ 2H wing variability. Results: A strong linear relationship was found between δ 2H wing and δ 2H GSP values (r 2=0.53). The resulting isoscape showed strong patterns across the Palearctic but limited variation and high uncertainty for the Afro-tropics. Positive residuals of this relationship were correlated with dry conditions for the month preceding sampling whereas negative residuals were correlated with more wet days for the month preceding sampling. High intra-site δ 2H wing variance was associated with lower relative humidity for the month preceding sampling and higher elevation. Conclusion: The δ 2H wing isoscape is applicable to trace butterﬂies, moths and other terrestrial herbivorous insects that migrate across the Afro-Palearctic range but has limited geolocation potential in the Afro-tropics. The spatial analysis of uncertainty using high-resolution climatic data demonstrated that many African regions with highly variable evaporation rates and relative humidity have δ 2H wing values that are less related to δ 2H GSP values. Increasing geolocation precision will require new modeling approaches using more time-speciﬁc environmental data and/or independent geolocation tools.},
