# Mexico City, Mexico

In February 2024, I was invited as part of the Canadian delegation to Mexico to participate in the Trilateral Scientific Group Meeting on the Monarch Butterfly. As one of the most junior attendees, this was an amazing opportunity for me to learn from researchers and conservation practitioners from Canada, the USA, and Mexico. I was also given the opportunity to deliver a short talk on my research so far.
