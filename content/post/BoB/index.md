# BoB

This year I attended my first [Biology of Butterflies](https://www.bob2023.cz/) conference in Prague from July 10-13. I gave a short talk on my research so far. It was fantastic to meet so many scientists whose papers I had been reading, learn about new discoveries, and reconnect with friends.
