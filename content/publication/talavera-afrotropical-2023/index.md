abstract: 'Migratory insects are key players in ecosystem functioning and services,
  but their spatiotemporal distributions are typically poorly known. Ecological niche
  modeling (ENM) may be used to predict species seasonal distributions, but the resulting
  hypotheses should eventually be validated by field data. The painted lady butterfly
  ( Vanessa cardui ) performs multigenerational migrations between Europe and Africa
  and has become a model species for insect movement ecology. While the annual migration
  cycle of this species is well understood for Europe and northernmost Africa, it
  is still unknown where most individuals spend the winter. Through ENM, we previously
  predicted suitable breeding grounds in the subhumid regions near the tropics between
  November and February. In this work, we assess the suitability of these predictions
  through i) extensive field surveys and ii) two-year monitoring in six countries:
  a large-scale monitoring scheme to study butterfly migration in Africa. We document
  new breeding locations, year-round phenological information, and hostplant use.
  Field observations were nearly always predicted with high probability by the previous
  ENM, and monitoring demonstrated the influence of the precipitation seasonality
  regime on migratory phenology. Using the updated dataset, we built a refined ENM
  for the Palearctic-African range of V. cardui . We confirm the relevance of the
  Afrotropical region and document the missing natural history pieces of the longest
  migratory cycle described in butterflies.'
