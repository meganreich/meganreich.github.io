abstract: Abiotic change can alter species interactions by modifying species' trophic
  roles, but this has not been well studied. Until now, bromeliad-dwelling tipulid
  larvae were thought to positively affect other macroinvertebrates via a facilitative
  processing chain. However, under drought, we found the opposite. We performed two
  microcosm experiments in which we factorially manipulated water level and predation
  by tipulids, and measured the effects on mosquito and chironomid larvae. The experiments
  differed in whether high water was contrasted with low or no water, allowing us
  to distinguish between the effects of desiccation stress (no water) and increased
  encounter rates due to compression of habitat or reductions in prey mobility (low
  and no water). We also included a caged tipulid treatment to measure any non-consumptive
  effects. As well as directly reducing prey survival, reductions in water level indirectly
  decreased chironomid and mosquito survival by altering the trophic role of tipulids.
  Our results suggest that increased encounter rates with prey led to tipulids becoming
  predatory under simulated drought, as tipulids consumed prey under both low and
  no water. When water level was high, tipulids exerted negative non-consumptive effects
  on prey survival. Because opportunistic predators are common throughout aquatic
  ecosystems, the effects of drought on the trophic roles of species may be widespread.
  Such restructuring of food webs should be considered when attempting to predict
  the ecological effects of environmental change.
