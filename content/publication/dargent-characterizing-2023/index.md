abstract: 'Eastern spruce budworm moth (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) mass outbreaks
  have widespread economic and ecological consequences. A key explanation for the
  large-scale spread and synchronization of these outbreaks is the long-distance dispersal
  (up to 450 km) of moths from hotspots (high-density populations) to lower-density
  areas. These events have proved difficult to monitor because dispersal flights occur
  only a few times a year, have no consistent routes, and commonly used tracking methods
  (e.g., population genetics, mark-recapture, radio telemetry) are inadequate for
  this system. Confirming immigration and distinguishing between local and immigrant
  individuals are crucial steps in identifying the physical and ecological drivers
  of moth dispersal. Here, we test whether isotopes of hydrogen (i.e., delta notation:
  δ2H) and strontium (i.e., strontium isotope ratios: 87Sr/86Sr), known to independently
  vary in space in a predictable manner, can be used to show that an immigration event
  occurred and to distinguish between local and immigrant adult spruce budworm moths.
  We used an automated pheromone trap system to collect individuals at six different
  sites in eastern Canada within and outside the current outbreak area of budworm
  moths. We first use moth flight behavior and time of capture, currently the best
  available tool, to determine putative local vs. immigrant status, and then evaluate
  whether individual 87Sr/86Sr and δ2H differ between putative classes. At two
  sites, we detect immigrant individuals that differ significantly from putative locals
  and thus confirm immigration has occurred. Saliently, sites where putative locals
  were sampled before the occurrence of potential immigration events (~10 days) showed
  the strongest differences between immigrant individuals’ and local 87Sr/86Sr
  and δ2H values. Sites where the collection of putative locals was close in time
  (hours) or following an immigration event (days) had a less-clear distinction between
  putative immigrants and locals, and showed signs of mixing between these two groups.
  We speculate that recent immigration could have led to the misclassification of
  immigrants as putative locals. 87Sr/86Sr and δ2H data generally support the
  adequacy of current approaches using capture-time to detect immigration events,
  and provide enhanced resolution to distinguish between local and immigrant individuals
  and to confirm an immigration event. We discuss the broader implication of adding
  isotopes to the toolkit to monitor spruce budworm dispersal and suggest next steps
  in implementing these tools.'
