abstract: 'The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is renowned for its virtually cosmopolitan distribution and the remarkable long-distance migrations as part of its annual, multigenerational migratory cycle. In winter, V. cardui individuals inhabit breeding grounds north and south of the Sahara, suggesting distinct migratory behaviors within the species as individuals migrate southward from Europe in the autumn. However, the evolutionary and ecological factors shaping these differences in migratory behavior remain largely unexplored. Here, we performed whole-genome resequencing and analyzed the hydrogen and strontium isotopes of 40 V. cardui individuals simultaneously collected in the autumn from regions both north and south of the Sahara. Our investigation revealed two main migratory groups: (i) shortdistance migrants, journeying from temperate Europe to the circum-Mediterranean region and (ii) long-distance migrants, originating from Europe, crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara, and reaching West Africa, covering up to over 4,000 km. Despite these stark differences in migration distance, a genome-wide analysis revealed that short- and long-distance migrants belong to a single intercontinental panmictic population extending from northern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to common biogeographic patterns, the Sahara is not a catalyst for population structuring in this species. No significant genetic differentiation or signs of adaptation and selection were observed between the two migratory phenotypes. Nonetheless, two individuals, who were early arrivals to West Africa covering longer migration distances, exhibited some genetic differentiation. The lack of genetic structure between short- and long-distance migrants suggests that migration distance in V. cardui is a plastic response to environmental conditions.'
