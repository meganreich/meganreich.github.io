	abstract = {Today, international travel and global freight transportation are increasing and have a direct influence on the introduction and establishment of non-native mosquito species as well as on the spread of arthropod (mosquito)-borne diseases inside Europe. One of the mosquito species that has become invasive in many areas is the Asian rock pool or bush mosquito Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (synonyms: Aedes japonicus japonicus or Hulecoeteomyia japonica japonica). This species was detected in Germany in 2008 for the first time. Until today, three different Oc. j. japonicus populations have been documented. Laboratory studies have shown that Oc. j. japonicus can act as a vector for a variety of disease agents. Thus, the knowledge on its current distribution is essential for different measurements. In the present study, ecological niche models were used to estimate the potential distribution of Oc. j. japonicus in Germany. The aim was to detect areas within Germany that could potentially function as habitats for this species. According to our model, areas in western, southern, and central Germany offer suitable conditions for the mosquito and may therefore be at risk for an invasion of the species. We strongly suggest that those areas should be monitored more intensively in the future. For this purpose, it would also be essential to search for possible dispersal routes as well as for natural barriers.},

	abstract = {Ochlerotatus japonicus japonicus (Theobald) is an invasive mosquito native to Japan, Korea, and eastern China. The species was first detected in the northeastern United States in 1998 and has rapidly spread throughout much of eastern North America. In addition to used tire casings, Oc. j. japonicus develops in a wide variety of artificial and natural container habitats, especially rock pools along stream beds. In an effort to evaluate the invasion success and impact of Oc. j. japonicus on populations of native container dwelling species, waste tire disposal sites and natural rock pool habitats were sampled for mosquito larvae throughout Connecticut in 2005, and data were compared with results from prior surveys made in 1987 and 1999. Oc. j. japonicus was the predominant species collected at the waste tire disposal sites regardless of surrounding landscape features, accounting for 55.9\% of all larvae. A comparison with collections from prior surveys revealed a 90\% reduction in the relative abundance of larval populations of Oc. triseriatus (Say) and significant reductions among larval populations of Oc. atropalpus (Coquillett) and Culex restuans Theobald. Oc. j. japonicus was also the most abundant mosquito collected in rock pool habitats, accounting for nearly 80\% of all collected larvae, except where water temperatures exceeded 30 degrees C. This was concomitant with significant declines in the relative abundance of Oc. atropalpus and Cx. restuans. We conclude that Oc. j. japonicus is a potentially effective competitor in rock pool and tire environments and may be responsible for reducing populations of several native species occupying these habitats through interspecific competition for limited resources. The exclusion of Oc. j. japonicus from warm water pools further suggests that a temperature barrier may exist for Oc. j. japonicus and that populations may not be able to colonize southern regions of the United States with relatively high summer temperatures.},

	abstract = {The Asian bush or rock pool mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus is one of the most expansive culicid species of the world. Being native to East Asia, this species was detected out of its original distribution range for the first time in the early 1990s in New Zealand where it could not establish, though. In 1998, established populations were reported from the eastern US, most likely as a result of introductions several years earlier. After a massive spread the mosquito is now widely distributed in eastern North America including Canada and two US states on the western coast. In the year 2000, it was demonstrated for the first time in Europe, continental France, but could be eliminated. A population that had appeared in Belgium in 2002 was not controlled until 2012 as it did not propagate. In 2008, immature developmental stages were discovered in a large area in northern Switzerland and bordering parts of Germany. Subsequent studies in Germany showed a wide distribution and several populations of the mosquito in various federal states. Also in 2011, the species was found in southeastern Austria (Styria) and neighbouring Slovenia. In 2013, a population was detected in the Central Netherlands, specimens were collected in southern Alsace, France, and the complete northeastern part of Slovenia was found colonized, with specimens also present across borders in adjacent Croatia. Apparently, at the end of 2013 a total of six populations occurred in Europe although it is not clear whether all of them are completely isolated. Similarly, it is not known whether these populations go back to the same number of introductions. While entry ports and long-distance continental migration routes are also obscure, it is likely that the international used tyre trade is the most important mode of intercontinental transportation of the mosquito. Aedes j. japonicus does not only display an aggressive biting behaviour but is suspected to be a vector of various disease agents and to displace indigenous culicid species. Therefore, Aedes j. japonicus might both cause public health problems in the future and have a significant impact on the biodiversity of the invaded territories.},

Mosquito microbiota is considered in the context of possible extended phenotypes conferred on the insect hosts that allow niche diversification and rapid adaptive evolution in other insects. These kinds of observations have prompted the recent development of new mosquito control methods based on the use of symbiotically-modified mosquitoes to interfere with pathogen transmission or reduce the host life span and reproduction. New opportunities for exploiting bacterial function for vector control are highlighted.},

The propensity of the newly-established mosquito Aedes japonicus to inhabit rock pools throughout the eastern United States provides a natural setting for interspecific larval competition with the native Aedes atropalpus. A laboratory experiment conducted in simulated rock pools to evaluate larval interactions between and within these two species suggested that the performance of both species was more significantly impacted by intraspecific conditions than interspecific conditions of the same mosquito density. Aedes atropalpus was apparently more sensitive to larval densities than Ae. japonicus because it reproduces autogenously, requiring a lengthened period of larval development to obtain nutrient reserves for egg development, which may ultimately put Ae. atropalpus at a disadvantage under larval conditions of competition and limited resources. Excessively stressful experimental conditions, as evidenced by reduced body size, and thus fecundity and estimated finite rate of increase, may have obscured the effects of larval competition between these species. The impact of larval competition between these species in rock pool communities warrants further investigation under more ecologically realistic experimental conditions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.watres.2014.11.003},
	abstract = {Microbial decay processes are one of the mechanisms whereby sewage contamination is reduced in the environment. This decomposition process involves a highly complex array of bacterial and eukaryotic communities from both sewage and ambient waters. However, relatively little is known about how these communities change due to mixing and subsequent decomposition of the sewage contaminant. We investigated decay of sewage in upper Mississippi River using Illumina sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA gene hypervariable regions and qPCR for human-associated and general fecal Bacteroidales indicators. Mixtures of primary treated sewage and river water were placed in dialysis bags and incubated in situ under ambient conditions for seven days. We assessed changes in microbial community composition under two treatments in a replicated factorial design: sunlight exposure versus shaded and presence versus absence of native river microbiota. Initial diversity was higher in sewage compared to river water for 16S sequences, but the reverse was observed for 18S sequences. Both treatments significantly shifted community composition for eukaryotes and bacteria (P{\textless}0.05). Data indicated that the presence of native river microbiota, rather than exposure to sunlight, accounted for the majority of variation between treatments for both 16S (R=0.50; P{\textgreater}0.001) and 18S (R=0.91; P=0.001) communities. A comparison of 16S sequence data and fecal indicator qPCR measurements indicated that the latter was a good predictor of overall bacterial community change over time (rho: 0.804-0.814, P=0.001). These findings suggest that biotic interactions, such as predation by bacterivorous protozoa, can be critical factors in the decomposition of sewage in freshwater habitats and support the use of Bacteroidales genetic markers as indicators of fecal pollution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exotic invasive plants alter the structure and function of native ecosystems and may influence the distribution and abundance of arthropod disease vectors by modifying habitat quality. This study investigated how invasive plants alter the ecology of Culex pipiens, an important vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in northeastern and midwestern regions of the United States.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Field and laboratory experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that three native leaf species (Rubus allegheniensis, blackberry; Sambucus canadensis, elderberry; and Amelanchier laevis, serviceberry), and three exotic invasive leaf species (Lonicera maackii, Amur honeysuckle; Elaeagnus umbellata, autumn olive; and Rosa multiflora, multiflora rose) alter Cx. pipiens oviposition site selection, emergence rates, development time, and adult body size. The relative abundance of seven bacterial phyla in infusions of the six leaf species also was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to test the hypothesis that variation in emergence, development, and oviposition site selection is correlated to differences in the diversity and abundance of bacteria associated with different leaf species, important determinants of nutrient quality and availability for mosquito larvae.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Leaf detritus from invasive honeysuckle and autumn olive yielded significantly higher adult emergence rates compared to detritus from the remaining leaf species and honeysuckle alleviated the negative effects of intraspecific competition on adult emergence. Conversely, leaves of native blackberry acted as an ecological trap, generating high oviposition but low emergence rates. Variation in bacterial flora associated with different leaf species may explain this asymmetrical production of mosquitoes: emergence rates and oviposition rates were positively correlated to bacterial abundance and diversity, respectively.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the displacement of native understory plant species by certain invasive shrubs may increase production of Cx. pipiens with potential negative repercussions for human and wildlife health. These findings may be relevant to mosquito control and invasive plant management practices in the geographic range of Cx. pipiens. Further, our discovery of a previously unknown ecological trap for an important vector of WNV has the potential to lead to novel alternatives to conventional insecticides in mosquito control by exploiting the apparent "attract-kill" properties of this native plant species.},

	abstract = {Amoebae are generally assumed to be asexual. We argue that this view is a relict of early classification schemes that lumped all amoebae together inside the 'lower' protozoa, separated from the 'higher' plants, animals and fungi. This artificial classification allowed microbial eukaryotes, including amoebae, to be dismissed as primitive, and implied that the biological rules and theories developed for macro-organisms need not apply to microbes. Eukaryotic diversity is made up of 70+ lineages, most of which are microbial. Plants, animals and fungi are nested among these microbial lineages. Thus, theories on the prevalence and maintenance of sex developed for macro-organisms should in fact apply to microbial eukaryotes, though the theories may need to be refined and generalized (e.g. to account for the variation in sexual strategies and prevalence of facultative sex in natural populations of many microbial eukaryotes). We use a revised phylogenetic framework to assess evidence for sex in several amoeboid lineages that are traditionally considered asexual, and we interpret this evidence in light of theories on the evolution of sex developed for macro-organisms. We emphasize that the limited data available for many lineages coupled with natural variation in microbial life cycles overestimate the extent of asexuality. Mapping sexuality onto the eukaryotic tree of life demonstrates that the majority of amoeboid lineages are, contrary to popular belief, anciently sexual, and that most asexual groups have probably arisen recently and independently. Additionally, several unusual genomic traits are prevalent in amoeboid lineages, including cyclic polyploidy, which may serve as alternative mechanisms to minimize the deleterious effects of asexuality.},

Although there is concern over the negative effects imposed by introduced species, positive effects are also possible. Introduced species may facilitate local resident species by providing or modifying habitat; these positive effects are sometimes overlooked, but are important for decisions about the local management of non-native species. The introduction of Zostera japonica to the Northeast Pacific coast is a case of a non-native foundation species that appears to expand total eelgrass habitat area, potentially facilitating local eelgrass-inhabiting species. In this study, we asked whether the non-native Z. japonica provides habitat for eelgrass-dwelling invertebrates that is similar to its native congener, Z. marina. We systematically quantified invertebrate assemblages in the two eelgrass species and quantified eelgrass characteristics that are relevant to epifaunal habitat quality (e.g. shoot density and surface area). We found that Z. japonica supports a greater total abundance of the same invertebrate species found in Z. marina meadows; however, the relative abundance of invertebrate species differed between Z. japonica and Z. marina. This result is consistent with differences in the two congeners’ morphological characteristics, density of vegetative and reproductive shoots, and total blade surface area per square metre. We conclude that the expansion of total eelgrass habitat due to the introduction of Z. japonica appears to increase the available habitat for local epifaunal invertebrate communities.},

	abstract = {An accurate reconstruction of the eukaryotic tree of life is essential to identify the innovations underlying the diversity of microbial and macroscopic (e.g., plants and animals) eukaryotes. Previous work has divided eukaryotic diversity into a small number of high-level "supergroups," many of which receive strong support in phylogenomic analyses. However, the abundance of data in phylogenomic analyses can lead to highly supported but incorrect relationships due to systematic phylogenetic error. Furthermore, the paucity of major eukaryotic lineages (19 or fewer) included in these genomic studies may exaggerate systematic error and reduce power to evaluate hypotheses. Here, we use a taxon-rich strategy to assess eukaryotic relationships. We show that analyses emphasizing broad taxonomic sampling (up to 451 taxa representing 72 major lineages) combined with a moderate number of genes yield a well-resolved eukaryotic tree of life. The consistency across analyses with varying numbers of taxa (88-451) and levels of missing data (17-69\%) supports the accuracy of the resulting topologies. The resulting stable topology emerges without the removal of rapidly evolving genes or taxa, a practice common to phylogenomic analyses. Several major groups are stable and strongly supported in these analyses (e.g., SAR, Rhizaria, Excavata), whereas the proposed supergroup "Chromalveolata" is rejected. Furthermore, extensive instability among photosynthetic lineages suggests the presence of systematic biases including endosymbiotic gene transfer from symbiont (nucleus or plastid) to host. Our analyses demonstrate that stable topologies of ancient evolutionary relationships can be achieved with broad taxonomic sampling and a moderate number of genes. Finally, taxon-rich analyses such as presented here provide a method for testing the accuracy of relationships that receive high bootstrap support (BS) in phylogenomic analyses and enable placement of the multitude of lineages that lack genome scale data.},

Recent studies of the natural history of these species have implicated catch basins and underground storm drain systems as important larval development sites in urban and suburban locales. Although the presence of larvae in these habitats is well-documented, the influence of abiotic factors on the ecology of Culex larvae developing in them remains poorly understood. Therefore, we examined the effects of multiple abiotic factors and their interactions on abundance of Culex larvae in catch basins in the Chicago, IL, metropolitan area. Low precipitation and high mean daily temperature were associated with high larval abundance, whereas there was no correlation between catch basin depth or water depth and larval abundance. Rainfall was an especially strong predictor of presence or absence of larvae in the summer of 2010, a season with an unusually high precipitation. Regression tree methods were used to build a schematic decision tree model of the interactions among these factors. This practical, visual representation of key predictors of high larval production may be used by local mosquito abatement districts to target limited resources to treat catch basins when they are particularly likely to produce West Nile virus vectors.},

It occurs also in tropical Southeast Asia and the North American Pacific coast, and the populations there are thought to have been introduced from Japan by ship. To test this hypothesis, the genetic divergence among geographic populations of A. togoi was studied using one mitochondrial and three nuclear gene sequences. We detected 71 mitochondrial haplotypes forming four lineages, with high nucleotide diversity around temperate Japan and declining towards peripheral ranges. The major lineage (L1) comprised 57 haplotypes from temperate and subarctic zones in Japan and Southeast Asia including southern China and Taiwan. Two other lineages were found from subtropical islands (L3) and a subarctic area (L4) of Japan. The Canadian population showed one unique haplotype (L2) diverged from the other lineages. In the combined nuclear gene tree, individuals with mitochondrial L4 haplotypes diverged from those with the other mitochondrial haplotypes L1-L3; although individuals with L1-L3 haplotypes showed shallow divergences in the nuclear gene sequences, individuals from Southeast Asia and Canada each formed a monophyletic group. Overall, the genetic composition of the Southeast Asian populations was closely related to that of temperate Japanese populations, suggesting recent gene flow between these regions. The Canadian population might have originated from anthropogenic introduction from somewhere in Asia, but the possibility that it could have spread across the Beringian land bridge cannot be ruled out.},

	abstract = {Host-associated microbes are ubiquitous. Every multicellular eukaryote, and even many unicellular eukaryotes (protists), hosts a diverse community of microbes. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) tools have illuminated the vast diversity of host-associated microbes and shown that they have widespread influence on host biology, ecology and evolution (McFall-Ngai et al. ). Bacteria receive most of the attention, but protists are also important components of microbial communities associated with humans (Parfrey et al. ) and other hosts. As HTS tools are increasingly used to study eukaryotes, the presence of numerous and diverse host-associated eukaryotes is emerging as a common theme across ecosystems. Indeed, HTS studies demonstrate that host-associated lineages account for between 2 and 12\% of overall eukaryotic sequences detected in soil, marine and freshwater data sets, with much higher relative abundances observed in some samples (Ramirez et al. ; Simon et al. ; de Vargas et al. ). Previous studies in soil detected large numbers of predominantly parasitic lineages such as Apicomplexa, but did not delve into their origin [e.g. (Ramirez et al. )]. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Geisen et al. () use mock communities to show that many of the eukaryotic organisms detected by environmental sequencing in soils are potentially associated with animal hosts rather than free-living. By isolating the host-associated fraction of soil microbial communities, Geisen and colleagues help explain the surprisingly high diversity of parasitic eukaryotic lineages often detected in soil/terrestrial studies using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and reinforce the ubiquity of these host-associated microbes. It is clear that we can no longer assume that organisms detected in bulk environmental sequencing are free-living, but instead need to design studies that specifically enumerate the diversity and function of host-associated eukaryotes. Doing so will allow the field to determine the role host-associated eukaryotes play in soils and other environments and to evaluate hypotheses on assembly of host-associated communities, disease ecology and more.},

	abstract = {Mammals have diversified into many dietary niches. Specialized myrmecophagous (ant- and termite-eating) placental mammals represent a textbook example of evolutionary convergence driven by extreme diet specialization. Armadillos, anteaters, aardvarks, pangolins and aardwolves thus provide a model system for understanding the potential role of gut microbiota in the convergent adaptation to myrmecophagy. Here, we expand upon previous mammalian gut microbiome studies by using high-throughput barcoded Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in 15 species representing all placental myrmecophagous lineages and their close relatives from zoo- and field-collected samples. We confirm that both diet and phylogeny drive the evolution of mammalian gut microbiota, with cases of convergence in global composition, but also examples of phylogenetic inertia. Our results reveal specialized placental myrmecophages as a spectacular case of large-scale convergence in gut microbiome composition. Indeed, neighbour-net networks and beta-diversity plots based on UniFrac distances show significant clustering of myrmecophagous species (anteaters, aardvarks and aardwolves), even though they belong to phylogenetically distant lineages representing different orders. The aardwolf, which diverged from carnivorous hyenas only in the last 10 million years, experienced a convergent shift in the composition of its gut microbiome to become more similar to other myrmecophages. These results confirm diet adaptation to be a major driving factor of convergence in gut microbiome composition over evolutionary timescales. This study sets the scene for future metagenomic studies aiming at evaluating potential convergence in functional gene content in the microbiomes of specialized mammalian myrmecophages.},

We describe the diversity of bacteria on red-backed salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) in the wild and the stability of these communities through time in captivity using culture-independent Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing. After field sampling, salamanders were housed with soil from the field or sterile media. The captive conditions led to different trajectories of bacterial communities. Eight OTUs present on {\textgreater}90\% of salamanders in the field, through time, and in both treatments were defined as the core community, suggesting that some bacteria are closely associated with the host and are independent of an environmental reservoir. One of these taxa, a Pseudomonas sp., was previously cultured from amphibians and found to be antifungal. As all host-associated bacteria were found in the soil reservoir, environmental microbes strongly influence host-microbial diversity and likely regulate the core community. Using PICRUSt, an exploratory bioinformatics tool to predict gene functions, we found that core skin bacteria provided similar gene functions to the entire community. We suggest that future experiments focus on testing whether core bacteria on salamander skin contribute to the observed resistance to chytridiomycosis in this species even under hygenic captive conditions. For disease-susceptible hosts, providing an environmental reservoir with defensive bacteria in captive-rearing programs may improve outcomes by increasing bacterial diversity on threatened amphibians or increasing the likelihood that defensive bacteria are available for colonization.},

	abstract = {Although macroscopic plants, animals, and fungi are the most familiar eukaryotes, the bulk of eukaryotic diversity is microbial. Elucidating the timing of diversification among the more than 70 lineages is key to understanding the evolution of eukaryotes. Here, we use taxon-rich multigene data combined with diverse fossils and a relaxed molecular clock framework to estimate the timing of the last common ancestor of extant eukaryotes and the divergence of major clades. Overall, these analyses suggest that the last common ancestor lived between 1866 and 1679 Ma, consistent with the earliest microfossils interpreted with confidence as eukaryotic. During this interval, the Earth's surface differed markedly from today; for example, the oceans were incompletely ventilated, with ferruginous and, after about 1800 Ma, sulfidic water masses commonly lying beneath moderately oxygenated surface waters. Our time estimates also indicate that the major clades of eukaryotes diverged before 1000 Ma, with most or all probably diverging before 1200 Ma. Fossils, however, suggest that diversity within major extant clades expanded later, beginning about 800 Ma, when the oceans began their transition to a more modern chemical state. In combination, paleontological and molecular approaches indicate that long stems preceded diversification in the major eukaryotic lineages.},

	abstract = {Research in host-parasite evolutionary ecology has demonstrated that environmental variation plays a large role in mediating the outcome of parasite infection. For example, crowding or low food availability can reduce host condition and make them more vulnerable to parasite infection. This observation that poor-condition hosts often suffer more from parasite infection compared to healthy hosts has led to the assumption that parasite productivity is higher in poor-condition hosts. However, the ubiquity of this negative relationship between host condition and parasite fitness is unknown. Moreover, examining the effect of environmental variation on parasite fitness has been largely overlooked in the host-parasite literature. Here we investigate the relationship between parasite fitness and host condition by using a laboratory experiment with the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni and its viral pathogen, AcMNPV, and by surveying published host-parasite literature. Our experiments demonstrated that virus productivity was positively correlated with host food availability and the literature survey revealed both positive and negative relationships between host condition and parasite fitness. Together these data demonstrate that contrary to previous assumptions, parasite fitness can be positively or negatively correlated with host fitness. We discuss the significance of these findings for host-parasite population biology.},

	abstract = {Aim The biogeography and global distribution of protists has long been disputed, with two primary, opposing views. To test these two sets of views in greater detail, we have compiled the available data for marine benthic ciliates and assessed the general patterns of their diversity and distribution compared with Metazoa. Location World-wide. Methods A comprehensive database (1342 species, over 350 sources) was used to analyse the diversity, distribution, species occurrences and range size distribution of free-living ciliates that inhabit marine sediments in 17 geographical regions. Results Twenty-five per cent of the species have been found in a single region only, whereas 18\% are widespread (they occur in more than half the regions covering both hemispheres). Only 5–7\% of regional faunas are endemic, which is much lower than for macroorganisms. Regional diversity depends neither on total area nor on coastline length and does not show any obvious latitudinal trends, but correlates highly with the investigation effort expended in a region and (negatively) with the average salinity. A comparison of species composition reveals distinctions between the Arctic Area (the White, Barents and Kara seas), Laurasian Area (north Atlantic, north Pacific and European seas), Gondwanian Area (Southern Ocean) and the Antarctic. No clear geographical correlations are found for faunistic com-position at the genus or family levels. There is the tendency to narrow the latitudinal ranges for species found at high latitudes (reversal of Rapoport's rule). Main conclusions Undersampling and data insufficiency are the key factors affecting the observed diversity and distribution of microorganisms. Nevertheless, marine benthic ciliates demonstrate certain patterns that generally agree with the 'moderate endemicity' model (Foissner, 2004, 2008), but consistently contradict the regularities commonly observed for multicellular taxa. Thus, ciliates do have a biogeography, but their macroecological patterns may be different in some respects from that of macroorganisms.},

	abstract = {Eukaryotic microbes (protists) residing in the vertebrate gut influence host health and disease, but their diversity and distribution in healthy hosts is poorly understood. Protists found in the gut are typically considered parasites, but many are commensal and some are beneficial. Further, the hygiene hypothesis predicts that association with our co-evolved microbial symbionts may be important to overall health. It is therefore imperative that we understand the normal diversity of our eukaryotic gut microbiota to test for such effects and avoid eliminating commensal organisms. We assembled a dataset of healthy individuals from two populations, one with traditional, agrarian lifestyles and a second with modern, westernized lifestyles, and characterized the human eukaryotic microbiota via high-throughput sequencing. To place the human gut microbiota within a broader context our dataset also includes gut samples from diverse mammals and samples from other aquatic and terrestrial environments. We curated the SILVA ribosomal database to reflect current knowledge of eukaryotic taxonomy and employ it as a phylogenetic framework to compare eukaryotic diversity across environment. We show that adults from the non-western population harbor a diverse community of protists, and diversity in the human gut is comparable to that in other mammals. However, the eukaryotic microbiota of the western population appears depauperate. The distribution of symbionts found in mammals reflects both host phylogeny and diet. Eukaryotic microbiota in the gut are less diverse and more patchily distributed than bacteria. More broadly, we show that eukaryotic communities in the gut are less diverse than in aquatic and terrestrial habitats, and few taxa are shared across habitat types, and diversity patterns of eukaryotes are correlated with those observed for bacteria. These results outline the distribution and diversity of microbial eukaryotic communities in the mammalian gut and across environments.},

We confirm the invasion of this mosquito, first reported in Yamagata city in northeast Honshu, Japan in 2000. Previously, only Ae. japonicus japonicus had been collected in this place, but 2 years later, the population of Ae. albopictus had increased, so more than 80\% of the total number of larval colonies there consisted of this species. In contrast to Yamagata's new residential area, now infested by Ae. albopictus, the original mosquito remains in the city but its habitats are generally closer to the surrounding mountains, where the normalized difference vegetation index is higher. The factors affecting the distribution of both species in Yamagata city were studied using geographical information systems (GIS) based on data derived from field surveys, aerial photographs, satellite images and digital maps. The range of Aedes mosquito habitats was estimated and visualised on polygon maps and no significant differences were noted when the polygon area was calculated by GIS software in comparison with the satellite images. Although Ae. j. japonicus was expected to be rapidly overrun by Ae. albopictus, this did not happen. Currently, both species coexist; not only in separate sites, but also simultaneously in various water bodies, where larvae from both species have frequently been seen. However, the competitive relationship between these two Aedes species within a warming environment is an issue that should be closely monitored.},

The invasive mosquito Aedes japonicus japonicus has established in the North American range of the competitively superior resident congener, Aedes albopictus, and the predatory native mosquito Toxorhynchites rutilus. We tested predictions for two hypotheses of invasion success and species coexistence: keystone predation and spatial partitioning. We tested competition between A. japonicus japonicus and A. albopictus with or without T. rutilus in laboratory microcosms, and measured abundances of A. japonicus japonicus, A. albopictus, other resident competing mosquito species, and the presence of T. rutilus among tree holes and tires in metropolitan Washington, DC. In laboratory microcosms, A. albopictus was competitively dominant over A. japonicus japonicus, which is consistent with the few prior studies of competition between these two Aedes species. T. rutilus predation severely lowered performances of both Aedes species but more severely lowered A. japonicus japonicus performance than A. albopictus performance when all three species co-occurred, thus yielding no evidence for keystone predation. Consistent with the spatial partitioning hypothesis, A. japonicus japonicus was negatively correlated and independently aggregated with A. albopictus and all combined resident mosquito competitors and was not associated with T. rutilus among field containers. These results suggest that predation from T. rutilus and competition from A. albopictus are barriers to the spread of A. japonicus japonicus, but that A. japonicus japonicus may escape these interspecific effects by utilizing spatially partitioned container habitats.},

Throughout its native and expanded range, Ae. j. japonicus larvae are commonly observed in many types of natural and artiÞcial water-Þlled containers that vary in organic matter content and exposure to sunlight. Larvae are most often found in containers with decaying leaf material or algae, and we postulated that the added autocthonous primary production from algae could be both an important food source for larvae and aninßuential oviposition attractant to adult Ae. j. japonicus.Wetested this hypothesisbyplacing plastic containers with varied levels of shading to manipulate algal density in the Þeld, and then monitored oviposition by natural populations of Ae. j. japonicus. Over 99\% of larvae hatching from eggs laid on the walls of our containers were Ae. j. japonicus, indicating that this species is a dominant colonizer of artiÞcial containers in the study areas. Although full shading treatments effectively reduced algal biomass (signiÞcant reduction in chlorophyll a levels), at only one of three sites did this appear to affect Ae. j. japonicus oviposition. We conclude that algae in larval habitats are not a major factor in oviposition choices of adult Ae. j. japonicus females except when in situ primary production is high enough to substantially alter overall organic matter content cues.

To ascertain the putative number of separate introductions to Europe and examine patterns of expansion we analyzed the genetic makeup of Ae. j. japonicus populations from five cemeteries in North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, two western German federal states, as well as of specimens from populations in Belgium, Switzerland, and Austria/Slovenia. To do so, we genotyped individual specimens at seven pre-existing polymorphic microsatellite loci and sequenced part of the nad4 mitochondrial locus. We found evidence of two different genotypic signatures associated with different nad4 mitochondrial haplotypes, indicating at least two genetically differentiated populations of Ae. j. japonicus in Europe (i.e. two distinct genotypes). Belgian, Swiss, and Austrian/Slovenian populations all share the same genotypic signature although they have become differentiated since isolation. Contrary to expectations, the German Ae. j. japonicus are not closely related to those in Belgium which are geographically nearest but are also highly inbred. German populations have a unique genotype but also evidence of mixing between the two genotypes. Also unexpectedly, the populations closest to the center of the German infestation had the highest levels of admixture indicating that separate introductions did not expand and merge but instead their expansion was driven by punctuated human-mediated transport. Critically, the resulting admixed populations have higher genetic diversity and appear invasive as indicated by their increased abundance and recent spread across western Germany.},

We recorded a total of 2346 butterflies (including Zygaenidae and Sesiidae) representing 83 species and 7025 moths of 534 species. 150 of these species were listed in the Red Data Book of Carinthia. In general, butterflies increased from 2002 to 2004 while moths declined. The highest increase rates of butterflies were obtained for the numbers of individuals of calcareous grassland specialists at the conservation sites, while their numbers were unchanged at the control sites. Similar trend differences between conservation and control sites were obtained for the Red Data Book butterfly species. On the contrary, the development of moth individuals was more positive at the control than the conservation sites for calcareous grassland specialists (only macro-moths) and species of the Red Data Book. However, change rates of species numbers were positively correlated between butterflies and moths. Principal Component Analysis revealed strong differences between the different sites, but mostly consistent results for butterflies and moths; however, stronger differences between years were only detected for some of the conservation sites for the butterfly communities. Our results show that butterflies as well as moths are suitable ecological indicator groups, but they do not yield identical results. Thus, butterflies are more suitable for the analysis of open habitats, whereas moths are suitable for open and forested habitats as well. Furthermore, butterflies might be a more sensitive indicator group than moths for the short-term detection of conservation measures, especially for the restoration of open habitat types.},

The role of pollinators in the evolution of floral traits has been questioned recently by broad community surveys, especially studies concerning variation in pollinator assemblages and visitation frequency, which suggest a diminished role of pollinators in floral evolution. Here, we investigate the relationships between six categories of floral traits of 29 species and 10 pollinator functional groups in an alpine meadow in the Hengduan Mountains of China, over three consecutive years. Simpson’s diversity index was used to estimate the level of pollinator generalization of each plant species by considering both pollinator groups and their relative visitation frequencies. Multivariate analyses indicated that eight of the ten pollinator groups showed constant preferences for at least two floral traits, leading to a relatively stable level of ecological generalization for most floral traits (two out of three categories), despite the fact that the level of generalization of the entire community varied across years. Shape preferences of butterflies, honeybees and beeflies varied such that open flowers exhibited a lower level of ecological generalization in 2007 than closed flowers, in contrast with the other 2 years. These results suggest that temporally stabilized preferences of diverse pollinators may contribute to the evolution of specialized versus generalized floral traits; however, their role may be moderated by variation in community structure, including both the composition and abundance of plants and pollinators.},

Ochlerotatus j. japonicus and Ae. albopictus became infected and transmitted EEE virus by bite after feeding on young chickens 1 d after they had been inoculated with EEE virus (viremias ranging from 107.0–8.7 plaque-forming units [PFU]/ml of blood). No Cx. pipiens (n = 20) had detectable levels of virus 14 d after feeding on an EEE-virus infected chicken with a viremia of 108.1 PFU per ml of blood. Depending on the viral titer in the donor chicken, infection rates ranged from 55–100\% for Oc. j. japonicus and 93–100\% for Ae. albopictus. In these two species, dissemination rates were identical to or nearly identical to infection rates. Depending on the viral titer in the blood meal, estimated transmission rates ranged from 15 to 25\% for Oc. j. japonicus and 59–63\% for Ae. albopictus. Studies of replication of EEE virus in Oc. j. japonicus showed that there was an "eclipse phase" in the first 4 d after an infectious blood meal, that viral titers peak by day 7 at around 105.7 per mosquito, and that virus escaped the mid-gut as soon as 3 d after the infectious blood meal. These data, combined with the opportunistic feeding behavior of Oc. j. japonicus in Asia and the reported expansion of its range in the eastern United States, indicate that it could function as a bridge vector for EEE virus between the enzootic Culiseta melanura (Coquillett)-avian cycle and susceptible mammalian hosts.},

We present national population trends for a species-rich and ecologically diverse insect group: widespread and common macro-moths in Britain. Two-thirds of the 337 species studied have declined over the 35yr study and 21\% (71) of the species declined {\textgreater}30\% 10yr−1. If IUCN (World Conservation Union) criteria are applied at the national scale, these 71 species would be regarded as threatened. The declines are at least as great as those recently reported for British butterflies and exceed those of British birds and vascular plants. These results have important and worrying implications for species such as insectivorous birds and bats, and suggests as-yet undetected declines may be widespread among temperate-zone insects.},

	abstract = {This study reviews the diet of 26 granivorous bird species of European temperate farmland, and evidence for the effects of agricultural practices on their invertebrate and plant foods, in order to assess whether the latter could have contributed to recent widespread population declines of farmland birds. Cereal grain and seeds of Polygonum (knotgrasses and persicarias), Stellaria (chickweeds) and Chenopodium (goosefoots) are important for the bird species considered. Seeds and green material of Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Brassicaceae are also widely used, the seeds of Asteraceae particularly by cardueline finches. Declining bird species are not associated with particular plant foods, but reductions in overall diversity and abundance of food plants have taken place in intensively managed arable land. Grassland intensification has reduced floral diversity, and the quantity and diversity of grass and broad-leaved seed produced, but some plant species of value to granivorous birds benefit from high-nitrogen environments and may increase in availability (e.g., Stellaria – chickweeds). During the breeding season, Acrididae (grasshoppers), Symphyta (sawflies), Araneae (spiders), Chrysomelidae (leaf-beetles), Curculionidae (weevils), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths and their larvae), Aphididae (aphids) and Tipulidae (crane-flies and their larvae) are important foods. The first four are associated with the diet of declining bird species, and all are sensitive to insecticide applications. Herbicide applications, increasing specialisation of farmland, loss of uncultivated field margin habitats, and ploughing are also associated with generally detrimental effects on invertebrate groups in arable habitats. In intensively managed grassland, loss of grasshoppers, ants, spiders and lepidopteran larvae removes an important source of food for younger chicks of a wide range of species. Some phytophagous taxa and predators, however, may be more abundant due to the greater standing biomass of plant material. Overall, intensification and specialisation of arable and grassland systems is likely to have reduced the availability of key invertebrate and seed foods for birds. However, there is also evidence that reversal of intensification, especially in arable systems can result in rapid recovery of these resources. In intensively managed farmland, uncultivated field margins, hedgerows, ditches and road verges are likely to become increasingly important sources of seed and invertebrate food for birds.},

Estimates of both absolute and relative population sizes are widely used in many aspects of population conservation and management. Mark–recapture studies are appropriate for estimating the absolute population sizes of a wide range of animals, in both open and closed populations, while relative abundances can be estimated from a variety of survey methods. Relative abundances are often used in a comparative way to compare both population size and fluctuations in abundance. Here, we used transect counts and capture–recapture studies to estimate the relative abundances and population sizes of a specialist butterfly, Theclinesthes albocincta (Lycaenidae) in three habitat fragments, over two consecutive years. The sizes of the three populations differed significantly between sites and were highly variable between years. One population was extremely small and is likely to become locally extinct. We found that estimates of relative abundance were highly correlated with estimates of population size (r 2 = 0.88, P = 0.017) derived from the open population models. The combination of transect counts and capture–recapture studies used in this study appears to be a very informative tool for the conservation and management of this butterfly species and could be extended to other insects.},

Protected species are legally protected even outside the protected areas and can be flagships for conservation in these areas, but their conservation aspects in these areas are poorly studied. We studied conservation aspects of a poorly known species, Yellow Monitor (Varanus flavescens), which is protected in most of its range countries, outside the protected areas in the Far-western lowlands of Nepal. We studied people's relationship, attitudes and threats to the species through questionnaire survey with adults and children in Parasan Village Development Committee of Kanchanpur District. We found that most of the adults were unaware about the protected status and importance of the species, and both adults as well as children killed the species. The study revealed that most of the killing occurred in agricultural land and children were more responsible for the killing than the adults. We found that monsoon vacation in schools increased the threat to the species. Our study revealed that fear from the species was the main reason and use of the species as food, medicine and hide were other reasons for killing of the species by adults. Low awareness was the major reason behind the killing by children as most of the killing was not related to any good reasons. We estimated that 87 individuals of the species could have been killed in the area in that year. Based on available evidences, we recommend further studies to predict the vulnerability of the species. Our study suggests that raising awareness among locals about its legal status and importance is the simple and efficient measure for the conservation of the species as well as for conserving other protected species outside the protected areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Nepal is small in size but rich in bio-cultural diversity. The rugged terrain of the country is home to a number of unique assemblages of fauna, some of which are endemic. Not only faunal resources the country also harbors some very ancient populations whose interrelationship with these diverse faunal resources is very intimate and thus demands scientific study. Animals play important role in both material and spiritual spheres of their life. There are more than hundred groups of such populations in the country and the group Tamang is one of these. The present paper studies Tamang-animal relationships in central Nepal. There is a growing trend of scientific ethnozoological studies all across the globe, but this field is yet in its infancy in Nepal. The country is losing important fauna as well as ancient human cultures at the advent of development processes. As a result, ethnozoological knowledge is also teetering on the brink of extinction. METHODS Ethnozoological data were collected by applying different participatory approaches techniques such as semi-structured interviews, participatory rural appraisal, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. Quantitative data were obtained by employing a household level questionnaire survey. Data were collected from the period of September 2004 to August 2005. Most of the animals were identified up to the species level with the help of standard taxonomic keys. RESULTS The Tamang community treasures knowledge on various uses of 41 genera belonging to 28 families. Out of total number of animals, 14.6\% belong to the Invertebrate group and the rest to the Vertebrate group. Of the total uses 58\% fall in the food and medicinal use category, 16\% in the magico-religious use category, 18\% in the category of omen indication, and 2\% each in the categories such as weather forecasting, trophy, ethnomusical and taboos. CONCLUSIONS The Tamang maintain strong ties with animals both at a material as well as spiritual level. While some animals are the sources of important traditional medicines, others are omen indicators and weather forecasters. High priority should be given in conservation of those animals which are of high consensus value to the community.},

	abstract = {Blood-feeding arthropods can harm their hosts in many ways, such as through direct tissue damage and anemia, but also by distracting hosts from foraging or watching for predators. Blood-borne pathogens transmitted by arthropods can further harm the host. Thus, effective behavioral and immunological defenses against blood-feeding arthropods may provide important fitness advantages to hosts if they reduce bites, and in systems involving pathogen transmission, if they lower pathogen transmission rate. We tested whether Rock Pigeons (Columba livia) have effective behavioral and immunological defenses against a blood-feeding hippoboscid fly (Pseudolynchia canariensis) and, if so, whether the two defenses interact. The fly vectors the blood parasite Haemoproteus columbae; we further tested whether these defenses reduced the transmission success of blood parasites when birds were exposed to infected flies. We compared four experimental treatments in which hosts had available both purported defenses, only one of the defenses, or no defenses against the flies. We found that preening and immunological defenses were each effective in decreasing the survival and reproductive success of flies. However, the two defenses were additive, rather than one defense enhancing or decreasing the effectiveness of the other defense. Neither defense reduced the prevalence of H. columbae, nor the intensity of infection in birds exposed to infected flies. Flies experience reduced fitness when maintained on hosts with immunological or preening defenses. This suggests that if vectors are given a choice among hosts, they may choose hosts that are less defended, which could impact pathogen transmission in a system where vectors can choose among hosts.},

	abstract = {The northern fowl mite (NFM; Ornithonyssus sylviarum) is a blood-feeding ectoparasite of birds and a major pest of poultry in the United States. Mite populations spread rapidly in commercial flocks, reach peak burdens of {\textgreater}70,000 mites per bird and have developed resistance to many pesticides. Despite decades as a pest in the United States, the reproductive biology of NFM remains unclear. Based on karyotypes, the NFM has haplodiploid sex determination, which suggests unmated females could produce male offspring (arrhenotoky). Thus, unmated females could disseminate to a new host and initiate an infestation by producing and mating with sons (oedipal mating). We used small capsules to isolate and recover NFM on host chickens. Mites in capsules could blood feed, develop and reproduce, but could not contact other mites. Individual larvae were matured in isolation to produce known, unmated females. We evaluated reproduction of (I) previously mated females (i) in isolation, or (ii) paired with a male, and (II) unmated (virgin) females in isolation. In each treatment we recorded the number and sexes of offspring produced over time. Mated NFM produced female and male offspring in isolation, or when paired with a male. When paired with a male, females produced a female-biased sex ratio of the offspring (F:M ratio {\textasciitilde}5:1). Unmated, female NFM produced exclusively male offspring when in isolation. When paired with their sons that had developed to maturity, the "virgin" females were able to mate and subsequently produce female offspring. This study found that females with immediate access to sperm produced mostly female offspring. Virgin female NFM initially produced only male offspring and subsequently used oedipal mating to produce female offspring. Using this reproductive system NFM could successfully colonize new hosts as immature, or unmated females. The strong female-biased sex ratio of NFM populations suggests a large proportion of the parasite population is capable of disseminating to new hosts, which is essential for an obligate parasite to persist.},

The decline in C. jejuni numbers during pupal development coincided with increased expression of antimicrobial peptides, including cecropin, diptericin, attacin, and defensin, in the larvaÐpupa transition stage and a later second peak in older pupae (4 or 48 h).

	abstract = {Aedes aegypti is the principal vector of Dengue viruses worldwide. We identified field collected insects with differential susceptibility to Dengue-2 virus (DENv-2) and used isofemale selection to establish susceptible and refractory strains based on midgut infection barriers. Previous experiments had identified higher expression of apoptosis-related genes in the refractory strain. To identify potential molecular mechanisms associated with DENv susceptibility, we evaluated the differential expression of Caspase-16, Aedronc, Aedredd, Inhibitor of apoptosis (AeIAP1) and one member of the RNAi pathway, Argonaute-2 in the midguts and fat body tissues of the selected strains at specific times post blood feeding or infection with DENv-2. In the refractory strain there was significantly increased expression of caspases in midgut and fatbody tissues in the presence of DENv-2, compared to exposure to blood alone, and significantly higher caspase expression in the refractory strain compared with the susceptible strain at timepoints when DENv was establishing in these tissues. We used RNAi to knockdown gene expression; knockdown of AeIAP1 was lethal to the insects. In the refractory strain, knockdown of the pro-apoptotic gene Aedronc increased the susceptibility of refractory insects to DENv-2 from 53\% to 78\% suggesting a contributing role of this gene in the innate immune response of the refractory strain.},

	abstract = {—The vector competence (VC) of Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae) varies geographically and is affected by both genetic and environmental factors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that influence VC may help develop novel control strategies. The selection of susceptible and refractory strains is the first step in this process. We collected immature A. aegypti in the field and established strains that were susceptible and refractory to Dengue-2 virus by isofamily selection through several generations. Infection was detected by immunofluorescence of head or midgut tissues to determine infection barriers and the \% of VC by tissue. We selected three strains: Susceptible (Cali-S) (96.4\% susceptible at F 19), Refractory with a midgut escape barrier (Cali-MEB) (44.1\% refractory at F 15), and Refractory with a midgut infection barrier (Cali-MIB) (40\% refractory at F 16). The effects of the infection were measured using Kaplan–Meier survival rates over the first seven generations. All selected strains showed a similar decrease in survival and in the number of eggs laid/female through the seven generations, suggesting that changes were a result of the selection process rather than the virus infection. The results of this study suggest that VC is associated with multiple genes, which have additive effects on susceptibility. Résumé—La compétence vectorielle (CV) d'Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) (Diptera: Culicidae) varie géographiquement et est influencée par des facteurs génétiques et environnementaux. Comprendre les mécanismes moléculaires qui affectent la CV pourrait aider à développer de nouvelles stratégies de contrôle des moustiques. La sélection de souches susceptibles et réfractaires est la première étape dans ce processus. Nous avons recueilli des A. aegypti immatures sur le terrain et des souches susceptibles et réfractaires au virus dengue-2 on été établies par la sélection d'isofamilles sur plusieurs générations. L'infection a été détectée par immunofluorescence sur des tissus de la tête ou de l'intestin moyen pour déterminer les barrières d'infection et le \% de CV par tissu. Nous avons sélectionné trois souches: Susceptible (Cali-S) (96,4\% sensibles à F 19), Réfractaire avec une barrière contre la dissémination dans l'intestin moyen (Cali-MEB) (44,1\% réfractaire à F 15) et Réfractaires avec une barrière contre l'infection dans l'intestin moyen (Cali-MIB) (40\% réfractaire à F 16). Les effets de l'infection ont été mesurés en utilisant les taux de survie de Kaplan–Meier au cours des sept premières générations. Toutes les souches sélectionnées ont montré une diminution similaire du taux de survie et du nombre d'oeufs pondus/ femelle à travers les sept générations, ce qui suggère que les changements sont le résultat du processus de sélection plutôt que l'infection par le virus. Les résultats de cette étude suggèrent que la CV est associée à de multiples gènes qui ont des effets additifs sur la susceptibilité.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.meegid.2016.05.036},
	abstract = {a b s t r a c t While human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) originates from ancient cross-species transmission of simian T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-1) from infected nonhuman primates, much debate exists on whether the first HTLV-1 occurred in Africa, or in Asia during early human evolution and migration. This topic is complicated by a lack of representative Asian STLV-1 to infer PTLV-1 evolutionary histories. In this study we obtained new STLV-1 LTR and tax sequences from a wild-born Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and performed detailed phylogenetic analyses using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference of available Asian PTLV-1 and Af-rican STLV-1 sequences. Phylogenies, divergence dates and nucleotide substitution rates were co-inferred and compared using six different molecular clock calibrations in a Bayesian framework, including both archaeological and/or nucleotide substitution rate calibrations. We then combined our molecular results with paleobiogeographical and ecological data to infer the most likely evolutionary history of PTLV-1. Based on the preferred models our analyses robustly inferred an Asian source for PTLV-1 with cross-species transmission of STLV-1 likely from a macaque (Macaca sp.) to an orangutan about 37.9–48.9 kya, and to humans between 20.3–25.5 kya. An orangutan diversification of STLV-1 commenced approximately 6.4–7.3 kya. Our analyses also inferred that HTLV-1 was first introduced into Australia {\textasciitilde}3.1–3.7 kya, corresponding to both genetic and ar-chaeological changes occurring in Australia at that time. Finally, HTLV-1 appears in Melanesia at {\textasciitilde}2.3–2.7 kya cor-responding to the migration of the Lapita peoples into the region. Our results also provide an important future reference for calibrating information essential for PTLV evolutionary timescale inference. Longer sequence data, or full genomes from a greater representation of Asian primates, including gibbons, leaf monkeys, and Su-matran orangutans are needed to fully elucidate these evolutionary dates and relationships using the model criteria suggested herein.},

Many migratory species provide ecosystem service benefits to society. For example, insectivorous bats prey on crop pests and reduce the need for pesticides; birds and insects pollinate food plants; and birds afford recreational opportunities to hunters and birdwatchers. Migration is driven by the seasonal availability of resources; as resources in one area become seasonally scarce, individuals move to locations where resources have become seasonally abundant. The separation of the annual lifecycle means that species management and governance is often fractured across international borders. Because migratory species depend on habitat in different locations, their ability to provide ecosystem services in one area depends on the spatial subsidies, or support, provided by habitat and ecological processes in other areas.

In this paper, we build upon earlier efforts to model 87Sr/86Sr in bedrock by developing GIS-based models for Sr isotopes in rock and water that include the combined effects of lithology and time. Using published data, we fit lithology-specific model parameters for generalized equations describing the concentration of radiogenic Sr in silicate and carbonate rocks. The new model explained more than 50\% of the observed variance in measured Sr isotope values from independent global databases of igneous, metaigneous, and carbonate rocks, but performed more poorly (explaining 33\% of the variance) for sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. In comparison, a previously applied model formulation that did not include lithology-specific parameters explained only 20\% and 8\% of the observed variance for igneous and sedimentary rocks, respectively, and exhibited an inverse relationship with measured carbonate rock values. Building upon the bedrock model, we also developed and applied equations to predict the contribution of different rock types to 87Sr/86Sr variations in water as a function of their weathering rates and strontium content. The resulting water model was compared to data from 68 catchments and shown to give more accurate predictions of stream water 87Sr/86Sr (R2=0.70) than models that did not include lithological weathering parameters. We applied these models to produce maps (“isoscapes”) predicting 87Sr/86Sr in bedrock and water across the contiguous USA, and compared the mapped Sr isotope distributions to data on Sr isotope ratios of US marijuana crops. Although the maps produced here are demonstrably imperfect and leave significant scope for further refinement, they provide an enhanced framework for lithology-based Sr isotope modeling and offer a baseline for provenance studies by constraining the 87Sr/86Sr in strontium sources at regional scales.},

	abstract = {ABStRACt: New larval control strategies for integrated vector management of Aedes aegypti are in high demand, including the use of biological control agents. Exposure of Aedes aegypti to parasites, starvation, and overcrowded conditions during larval development reduces the probability of survival to eclosion, can directly affect fitness parameters such as adult size and fecundity, and can affect the size, provisioning, and viability of eggs produced by females. We compared these parameters after exposing larvae to 1) abundant food at low larval densities, 2) food deprivation and high larval density, and 2) infection with the endoparasite Plagiorchis elegans, an entomopathogenic digenean trematode. Female mosquitoes that eclosed from larval conditions of starvation and overcrowding were smaller and laid fewer and smaller eggs than controls. The proportion of females to complete an oviposition cycle was reduced in the P. elegans-infected treatment group. Parasite load was negatively correlated with wing length and egg size. Infection of Ae. aegypti with P. elegans has sublethal effects and may reduce population-level reproductive output, but one-time low-density P. elegans exposure does not have sufficient effect on Ae. aegypti fitness parameters to be considered a viable biocontrol option.

Data released earlier this year by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Mexico and the North American Butterfly Association (NABA) suggest that reduced success during migration, due to environmental and anthropogenic factors, may help explain the falling monarch population (see the figure).},

Ecologists have recently developed renewed 31 interest in the concept. Hutchinson divided factors defining the niche into two categories: 32 bionomic and scenopoetic. Technological advances now allow ecologists to use stable 33 isotope analyses to quantify these niche dimensions. Analogously, we define the isotopic 34 niche as an area (in !-space) with isotopic values (!-values) as coordinates. We illustrate the 35 isotopic niche with two examples: the ontogenetic niche and the application of historic 36 ecology to conservation biology. To make isotopic measurements comparable to other niche 37 formulations we propose transforming !-space to p-space, where axes represent relative 38 proportions of isotopically distinct resources incorporated into an animal's tissues. 39 Sustaining renewed interest in the niche requires novel methods to measure variables that 40 define it. Stable isotope analyses are a natural, perhaps crucial, tool in contemporary 41 studies of the ecological niche. 42 43 In A Nutshell 44},

	volume = {45},
	abstract = {The Sr isotope composition measured in skeletal elements (e.g., bone, teeth, or antlers) can be used to infer the geographic region that an animal or human inhabited, because different regions tend to have distinct Sr isotope compositions, and natural variations in the relative abundance of Sr isotopes are not changed as Sr is processed through the food chain. Therefore, an organism that ingests Sr from one region can have a Sr isotope composition that is different than that of an organism that ingests Sr from another region. The Sr isotope composition of skeletal elements is a reflection of the concentration-weighted average of dietary Sr that was ingested while that skeletal element was produced. Because different skeletal elements grow and exchange Sr at different stages during the life times of organisms, Sr isotope analysis of different skeletal elements can be used to infer changes in geographic location at different stages in an organism’s life. The Sr isotope composition measured in human teeth will reflect the average Sr isotope composition that was ingested as a child, due to the immobile nature of Sr and Ca in teeth after formation, whereas the Sr isotope composition of bone will reflect the average isotopic composition over the last ten years of life, due to continuous biological processing of Sr and Ca in bone. Inferring the average isotopic composition of dietary Sr is best done by analyzing skeletal fragments from control groups, which might be animals that have the same feeding habits as the animal in question, or, in the case of humans, analysis of close family relatives. In cases where it is not possible to construct a Sr isotope database from control groups, it becomes necessary to estimate the isotopic composition of dietary Sr based on geologic principles. We present three case studies from our research that illustrate a range of approaches: (1) results from a criminal case where a deer was illegally harvested and the location of the deer was important to establish, (2) a pilot study of commingled human remains from a burial in Vietnam, associated with the Vietnam Conflict, and (3) a study of 13th and 14th century migration of people from an archeological site in the Southwest United States.},

Although 87Sr/86Sr values are highly variable across the region, the Sr isoscape shows multi-scalar patterns that are dependent on local-to-regional trends in surficial geology. High values are found in bedrock-dominated areas such as the Black Hills (SD) and Ozark Uplift (MO), or formerly glaciated areas where surface deposits are dominated by ice-transported Precambrian clasts. The lowest values are found in river valleys that incorporate eroded Neogene sediments into terrace formation. Intermediate values are found in upland loess and alluvial deposits which blanket much of the study area. We demonstrate trends in large-scale variability of the Midcontinent’s 87Sr/86Sr isoscape and suggest that future refinement focus on sub-regional trends in Sr isotope variability.},

A thorough environmental sampling strategy will ensure that all the variability within a selected region is documented, which is a critical step to improving the accuracy of sourcing studies. Furthermore, shared strontium baseline data collections are needed to improve the intercomparability of datasets and results. This paper provides a case study from a semiarid region in northwestern New Mexico, USA, highlighting the need for a bottom-up approach to baseline data collection (from bedrock to animal) and describes the methods of pre-field planning and collecting, including rationales for what samples to collect for Sr isotope baseline data.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0031891},
	abstract = {Each year, millions of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate up to 3000 km from their overwintering grounds in central Mexico to breed in eastern North America. Malcolm et al. (1993) articulated two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses to explain how Monarchs re-colonize North America each spring. The 'successive brood' hypothesis proposes that monarchs migrate from Mexico to the Gulf Coast, lay eggs and die, leaving northern re-colonization of the breeding range to subsequent generations. The 'single sweep' hypothesis proposes that overwintering monarchs continue to migrate northward after arriving on the Gulf coast and may reach the northern portion of the breeding range, laying eggs along the way. To examine these hypotheses, we sampled monarchs throughout the northern breeding range and combined stable-hydrogen isotopes (dD) to estimate natal origin with wing wear scores to differentiate between individuals born in the current vs. previous year. Similar to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that the majority of the northern breeding range was re-colonized by the first generation of monarchs (90\%). We also estimated that a small number of individuals (10\%) originated directly from Mexico and, therefore adopted a sweep strategy. Contrary to Malcolm et al. (1993), we found that 62\% of monarchs sampled in the Great Lakes originated from the Central U.S., suggesting that this region is important for sustaining production in the northern breeding areas. Our results provide new evidence of re-colonization patterns in monarchs and contribute important information towards identifying productive breeding regions of this unique migratory insect.},

We found the majority of monarchs (88\%) originated in the mid-west and Great Lakes regions, providing, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence that second generation monarchs born in June complete a (trans-) longitudinal migration across the Appalachian mountains. The remaining individuals (12\%) originated from parents that migrated directly from the Gulf coast during early spring.

	abstract = {The migration of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) from Canada and the United States to over-wintering sites in Mexico is one of the world's most amazing biological phenomena, although recent threats make it imperative that the resources needed by migrating monarchs be conserved. The most important first step in preserving migration resources-determining the migration flyways-is also the most challenging because of the large-scale nature of the migration. Prior attempts to determine the flyways using mark-recapture techniques with wing tags gave some clues, but this important information has never been fully obtainable until now. In 2005 the citizen-science program, Journey North, initiated a project that asked participants to record sightings of overnight roosts of monarchs during their fall migration, and this project now provides an ideal way to illustrate the flyways used by monarchs on their way to Mexico, with the assumption that roost locations indicate migration routes. We used 3 years of this data to elucidate the flyways on a continent-wide scale, that revealed two distinct flyways, but only one appears to lead directly to Mexico. This main, 'central' flyway begins in the American Midwest states and southern Ontario, then continues south-southwest through the states of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and finally passes through Texas and northern Mexico. These data also highlighted a separate, smaller flyway along the eastern and coastal states, but there was a noticeable lack of roost sightings in this flyway at lower latitudes. Since there are few recoveries of marked monarchs in Mexico originating from coastal areas, we compared the timing of roost formation in this 'eastern' flyway with the main, central flyway. Roosts in the eastern flyway lagged behind the central roosts in timing, suggesting that monarchs traveling in this flyway have a reduced chance of making it to the Mexico wintering site. Combined, our evidence indicates that locations in the central flyway should be considered priority areas for conserving migration resources.},

	abstract = {Production patterns of highly mobile species, such as anadromous fish, often exhibit high spatial and temporal heterogeneity across landscapes. Such variability is often asynchronous in time among habitats, which stabilizes production at aggregate scales of complexity. Reconstructing production patterns explicitly in space and time across multiple scales, however, remains difficult but is important for prioritizing habitat conservation. This is especially true for fishes inhabiting river basins due to long-range dispersal, high mortality at early life stages, complex population structure and elusive life history variation. We develop a new approach for mapping production patterns of Pacific salmon across a large river basin by integrating otolith microchemistry and dendritic isoscape models. The geographically continuous Bayesian assignment framework presented here yielded high accuracies ({\textgreater}90\%) and relatively high precisions (precisions {\textless}4\%; i.e., assignment areas of {\textless}530 river km of the 13 100 km total river length) when used to determine the natal source of known-origin juvenile Chinook salmon captured throughout the study region. Integrating these methods enabled us to base estimates of provenance and habitat use of individuals on a per location basis using strontium isotopic data throughout the continuous spatial domain of a river network. Such a framework provides substantial advantages over the more common nominal approach to employing otolith microchemistry to reconstruct movement patterns of fish. In doing so, we reconstructed the spatial production patterns of adult Chinook salmon returning to a large watershed in Bristol Bay, Alaska and illustrate the power of such an approach to conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {(87)Sr/(86)Sr reference maps (isoscapes) are a key tool for investigating past human and animal migrations. However, there is little understanding of which biosphere samples are best proxies for local bioavailable Sr when dealing with movements of past populations. In this study, biological and geological samples (ground vegetation, tree leaves, rock leachates, water, soil extracts, as well as modern and archeological animal teeth and snail shells) were collected in the vicinity of two early medieval cemeteries ("Thuringians", 5-6th century AD) in central Germany, in order to characterize (87)Sr/(86)Sr of the local biosphere. Animal tooth enamel is not appropriate in this specific context to provide a reliable (87)Sr/(86)Sr baseline for investigating past human migration. Archeological faunal teeth data (pig, sheep/goat, and cattle) indicates a different feeding area compared to that of the human population and modern deer teeth (87)Sr/(86)Sr suggest the influence of chemical fertilizers. Soil leachates do not yield consistent (87)Sr/(86)Sr, and (87)Sr/(86)Sr of snail shells are biased towards values for soil carbonates. In contrast, water and vegetation samples seem to provide the most accurate estimates of bioavailable (87)Sr/(86)Sr to generate Sr isoscapes in the study area. Long-term environmental archives of bioavailable (87)Sr/(86)Sr such as freshwater bivalve shells and tree cores were examined in order to track potential historic anthropogenic contamination of the water and the vegetation. The data obtained from the archeological bivalve shells show that the modern rivers yield (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios which are similar to those of the past. However, the tree cores registered decreasing (87)Sr/(86)Sr values over time towards present day likely mirroring anthropogenic activities such as forest liming, coal mining and/or soil acidification. The comparison of (87)Sr/(86)Sr of the Thuringian skeletons excavated in the same area also shows that the vegetation samples are very likely anthropogenically influenced to some extent, affecting especially (87)Sr/(86)Sr of the shallow rooted plants.},

We investigated landscape use in Australopithecus africanus and Paranthropus robustus from the Sterkfontein and Swartkrans cave sites in South Africa using strontium isotope analysis, a method that can help to identify the geological substrate on which an animal lived during tooth mineralization. Here we show that a higher proportion of small hominins than large hominins had non-local strontium isotope compositions. Given the relatively high levels of sexual dimorphism in early hominins, the smaller teeth are likely to represent female individuals, thus indicating that females were more likely than males to disperse from their natal groups. This is similar to the dispersal pattern found in chimpanzees, bonobos and many human groups, but dissimilar from that of most gorillas and other primates. The small proportion of demonstrably non-local large hominin individuals could indicate that male australopiths had relatively small home ranges, or that they preferred dolomitic landscapes.},

More recently the development of large scale models of spatial isotopic variation (isoscapes) has contributed to improved geographic assignments of human and animal origins. Persistent challenges remain, however, in the accurate identification of individual geographic origins from skeletal isotope data in studies of human (and animal) migration and provenance. In an attempt to develop and test more standardized and quantitative approaches to geographic assignment of individual origins using isotopic data two methods, combining 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O isoscapes, are examined for the Circum-Caribbean region: 1) an Interval approach using a defined range of fixed isotopic variation per location; and 2) a Likelihood assignment approach using univariate and bivariate probability density functions. These two methods are tested with enamel isotope data from a modern sample of known origin from Caracas, Venezuela and further explored with two archaeological samples of unknown origin recovered from Cuba and Trinidad. The results emphasize both the potential and limitation of the different approaches. Validation tests on the known origin sample exclude most areas of the Circum-Caribbean region and correctly highlight Caracas as a possible place of origin with both approaches. The positive validation results clearly demonstrate the overall efficacy of a dual-isotope approach to geoprovenance. The accuracy and precision of geographic assignments may be further improved by better understanding of the relationships between environmental and biological isotope variation; continued development and refinement of relevant isoscapes; and the eventual incorporation of a broader array of isotope proxy data.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56\% (coarse fragments) and 83\% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61\%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230\%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced.

Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America re-colonize the breeding range over several generations that result in population densities that vary across space and time during the breeding season. We used laboratory experiments to measure the strength of density-dependent intraspecific competition on egg laying rate and larval survival and then applied our results to density estimates of wild monarch populations to model the strength of density dependence during the breeding season. Egg laying rates did not change with density but larvae at high densities were smaller, had lower survival, and weighed less as adults compared to lower densities. Using mean larval densities from field surveys resulted in conservative estimates of density-dependent population reduction that varied between breeding regions and different phases of the breeding season. Our results suggest the highest levels of population reduction due to density-dependent intraspecific competition occur early in the breeding season in the southern portion of the breeding range. However, we also found that the strength of density dependence could be almost five times higher depending on how many life-stages were used as part of field estimates. Our study is the first to link experimental results of a density-dependent reduction in vital rates to observed monarch densities in the wild and show that the effects of density dependent competition in monarchs varies across space and time, providing valuable information for developing robust, year-round population models in this migratory organism.},

	abstract = {Different approaches are used to study wood provenance, but most of them are based on tracers in wood that are generally controlled by climatic factors. The strontium isotopic ratio 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in trees and soils is related to the signature of the local bedrock. Despite being used in diverse archaeological studies, Sr isotopes have rarely been used to trace the provenance of archaeological wood and especially wood from shipwrecks. In addition, recent analytical advances have allowed the detection of mass-dependent fractionation of Sr isotopes during biogeochemical processes, as reflected in the variation of d 88/86 Sr values between different environmental materials. The d 88/86 Sr values could be used in conjunction with the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratio to improve constraints on the sources of Sr in the archaeological materials being studied. This paper discusses the potential and limitations of using both of these Sr isotope ratios to trace the provenance of wood from shipwrecks. We review the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and d 88/86 Sr variations in rocks, waters, soils, plants and other living organisms and discuss how to determine the local Sr isotopic signature of potential sites. We also compile a list of known wood post mortem modifications in seawater. Possible implications in terms of the modification of the original Sr isotope ratios of wood during storage in seawater are illustrated through preliminary observations. This paper points out some limitations and perspectives for using Sr isotopes in provenancing wood from shipwrecks, and suggests future research to test and apply this approach for tracing the origin of archaeological wood.},

	abstract = {Archaeological research has highlighted the importance of population movement and interaction in promoting cultural change and interaction in past societies. Strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) are used worldwide to track prehistoric human population movement, and recent studies have provided new insight into the role of population diversity in the pre-Columbian American midcontinent. To track such movement, we have analyzed enamel from 222 small nonmigratory terrestrial and semiaquatic fauna from a series of midcontinental geographic locations to provide initial baseline regional 87 Sr/ 86 Sr information. Results of this study reveal considerable overlap in the strontium isotope ranges within the midcontinent, but also identify important isotopic differences between regions. We conclude that sufficient Sr variation exists within the midcontinent to identify the movement of individuals, however, the lack of regional specificity in Sr currently limits our ability to identify specific place(s) of origin for these individuals using Sr alone. Continued isotopic research offers the potential to produce a more detailed midcontinental isoscape, which combined with other geochemical, biological, and archaeological data, allows us to refine our understanding of the movement of people in pre-Columbian America. In light of this new information, we revisited our earlier case study of Cahokian immigration, reassessing new samples (558 teeth representing 338 individuals), and confirmed that the Cahokian population included a large number of nonlocal residents.},

	abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o Strontium isotope ratios assist ecosystem scientists in constraining the sources of alkaline earth elements, but their interpretation can be difficult because of complexities in mineral weathering and in the geographical and environmental controls on elemental additions and losses. Hawaii is a "natural laboratory" where a number of important biogeochemical variables have either limited ranges or vary in systematic ways, providing a unique opportunity to understand the impact of time, climate, and atmospheric inputs on the evolution of base cation sources to ecosystems. There are three major sources of strontium (Sr) to these ecosystems, each with distinct isotopic compositions: basalt lava, Asian dust, and rainfall. We present Sr isotope and concentration data on both bulk soil digests and NH 4 Ac extracts from soil profiles covering a wide range of environments and substrate ages. Bulk soil material from dry climates and/or young substrate ages with N 80 µg g − 1 Sr retain basalt-like Sr isotopic signatures, whereas those with Sr concentrations b 80 µg g − 1 can have isotope signatures that range from basalt-like values to the more radiogenic values associated with continental dust. Although both dust accumulation and lava weathering are time-and rainfall-dependent, the overall concentration of Sr drops with increasing leaching even as quartz and mica derived from continental dust sources increase to N 40\% by mass. At elevated dust levels, lava-derived Sr is low and dust-derived Sr is the dominant control of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in bulk soils; however, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of NH 4 Ac-extractable Sr largely reflects atmospheric deposition of marine aerosol in these situations. Overall, whole-soil Sr isotope values are controlled by complex interactions between Sr provided by lava weathering but partially lost by leaching, and Sr provided by dust but held in more resistant minerals. The isotopic composition of NH 4 Ac-extractable Sr and of the biota is controlled by lava weathering and rainfall contribution of Sr with only minor contributions from radiogenic dust sources.},

	abstract = {Sr isotopes are widely used as a tracer of Sr and Ca in surficial systems. Basalt flows ranging in age from 3 ka (kiloyears ago) to {\textgreater} 200 ka from El Malpais National Monument (EMNM), New Mexico provide an ideal setting to examine strontium, and hence calcium cycling by plants in a semi-arid woodland. To gauge plant dependence on atmospheric dust versus local weathering products for strontium and calcium, we measured 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in local bedrock and soils, and compared them to leaf/wood cellulose of four different conifers , a deciduous tree, three shrubs, an annual C 4 grass, and a lichen. Sampling sites varied by parent material (limestone, sandstone, granite, and basalt) and age (Quaternary to Precambrian), providing a wide range in end-member 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, whereas the target plant species varied in physiognomy, life history, and rooting depth. On non-basalt parent material, the contribution from dust changed with the supply of weath-erable Sr-bearing minerals in local bedrock. Soils developed on Paleozoic limestone showed significant bed-rock contributions. On basalts, the Sr budget of soils at EMNM is dominated by atmospheric dust on young, 3 ka flows, incorporates a mixture of basalt-dust in 9 ka flows, and is basalt-dominated in 120 ka flows. This is unlike the pattern observed in tropical soils developed on basalt in Hawaii, where basalt weathering dominates the Sr inventory of the youngest soils and aerosols dominate in older, deeply weathered soils. This contrast is mainly due to different water/rock (W/R) ratios: bedrock subjected to high W/R over short periods is quickly (b 10 ka) depleted in Sr (and Ca), except for the ongoing replenishment from aerosols. In arid settings where W/R are lower, soil Sr is still abundantly available first from dust, and increasingly from bedrock even after 120 ka. For plants, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations within and across sites at EMNP showed that evergreen trees varied most in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, shrubs were least dependent on eolian input of Sr, and both foliage density and rooting depths influence soil Sr pools.},

	abstract = {To assess the change in the size of the eastern North American monarch butterfly summer population, studies have used long-term data sets of counts of adult butterflies or eggs per milkweed stem. Despite the observed decline in the monarch population as measured at overwintering sites in Mexico, these studies found no decline in summer counts in the Mid-west, the core of the summer breeding range, leading to a suggestion that the cause of the monarch population decline is not the loss of Midwest agricultural milkweeds but increased mortality during the fall migration. Using these counts to estimate population size, however, does not account for the shift of monarch activity from agricultural fields to non-agricultural sites over the past 20 years, as a result of the loss of agricultural milkweeds due to the near-ubiquitous use of glyphosate herbicides. We present the counter-hypotheses that the proportion of the monarch population present in non-agricultural habitats, where counts are made, has increased and that counts reflect both population size and the proportion of the population observed. We use data on the historical change in the proportion of milkweeds, and thus monarch activity, in agricultural fields and non-agricultural habitats to show why using counts can produce misleading conclusions about population size. We then separate out the shifting proportion effect from the counts to estimate the population size and show that these corrected summer monarch counts show a decline over time and are correlated with the size of the overwintering population. In addition, we present evidence against the hypothesis of increased mortality during migration. The milkweed limitation hypothesis for monarch decline remains supported and conservation efforts focusing on adding milkweeds to the landscape in the summer breeding region have a sound scientific basis.

	abstract = {Since the discovery of monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) overwintering colonies in Mexico in the 1970s, it was assumed that monarchs from eastern North America migrated only to Mexico. This paper reveals that monarchs from Canada and the east coast of the United States also regularly travel to Cuba during the migration period. The natal grounds of Cuban monarchs were determined through the combined use of stable hydrogen (8D) and stable carbon (813C) isotope measurements and by cardenolide fingerprint analysis using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The TLC data revealed that there was an influx of migrants in November to Cuba, and the stable isotope data revealed that migrant Cuban monarchs originated from southeastern Canada and the eastern United States. Our findings suggest that North American migrant monarchs that move to Cuba hybridize with resident populations there and do not return to the continent. The differences in the natal grounds, migratory route, and reproductive stages between monarchs wintering in Mexico and Cuba suggest that there are at least two subpopulations of eastern North American monarchs. The extent to which Cuba may act as a bridge for monarch movement to the Yucatan and other Caribbean islands and the genetic impact of this newly revealed flux in monarch movements remain to be determined.},

	abstract = {Climate change can profoundly alter species' distributions due to changes in temperature, precipitation, or seasonality. Migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) may be particularly susceptible to climate-driven changes in host plant abundance or reduced overwin-tering habitat. For example, climate change may significantly reduce the availability of overwintering habitat by restricting the amount of area with suitable microclimate conditions. However, potential effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations remain largely unknown, particularly with respect to their milkweed (Asclepias spp.) host plants. Given that monarchs largely depend on the genus Asclepias as larval host plants, the effects of climate change on monarch northward migrations will most likely be mediated by climate change effects on Asclepias. Here, I used MaxEnt species distribution modeling to assess potential changes in Asclepias and monarch distributions under moderate and severe climate change scenarios. First, Asclepias distributions were projected to extend northward throughout much of Canada despite considerable variability in the environmental drivers of each individual species. Second, Asclepias distributions were an important pre-dictor of current monarch distributions, indicating that monarchs may be constrained as much by the availability of Asclepias host plants as environmental variables per se. Accordingly , modeling future distributions of monarchs, and indeed any tightly coupled plant-insect system, should incorporate the effects of climate change on host plant distributions. Finally, MaxEnt predictions of Asclepias and monarch distributions were remarkably consistent among general circulation models. Nearly all models predicted that the current monarch summer breeding range will become slightly less suitable for Asclepias and monarchs in the future. Asclepias, and consequently monarchs, should therefore undergo expanded northern range limits in summer months while encountering reduced habitat suitability throughout the northern migration.},

Restoring habitat that includes milkweeds, the only host plants for larval monarch butterflies, is necessary to increase monarch numbers within the breeding range. The value of different milkweed species for restoration will depend, in part, on the extent to which they are utilized by ovipositing females. The number of eggs laid on different species over a season will be a function of plant size and phenology as well as female preference. We examined seasonal egg deposition and females’ oviposition choices by comparing the number of eggs laid by free-flying wild monarchs on each of nine native milkweed species occurring in Iowa (Asclepias syriaca, Asclepias tuberosa, Asclepias incarnata, Asclepias verticillata, Asclepias exaltata, Asclepias hirtella, Asclepias speciosa, Asclepias sullivantii, and Cynanchum laeve). One plot, consisting of clusters of each of the nine species, was established at each of 14 sites across the state of Iowa. Eggs were counted weekly in June, July and August 2015-2017. The highest egg totals were recorded on A. incarnata and A. syriaca in all years. Fewer eggs were counted on A. exaltata, A. hirtella, A. tuberosa, A. verticillata, and C. laeve.

In 2012, monarch butterflies migrated well beyond their usual range, resulting in an extended breeding distribution compared to typical years. We used stable isotope (δ 2 H, δ 13 C) measurements in wing chitin to determine the area of natal origin of these butterflies. Most monarch butterflies collected in May, June, and July from Manitoba and Alberta, Canada had natal origins in the North American Midwest. Monarch butterflies collected in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada in August and September had local natal origins indicating successful recruitment of offspring from colonising individuals. However, it is unknown whether these offspring migrated successfully to overwintering areas. Our work highlights the ability of monarch butterflies to colonise distant breeding areas and demonstrates how stable isotopes can be used to understand the dynamics of range-edge populations.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) of archaeological samples (teeth and bones) can be used to track mobility and migration across geologically distinct landscapes. However, traditional interpolation algorithms and classification approaches used to generate Sr isoscapes are often limited in predicting multiscale 87Sr/86Sr patterning. Here we investigate the suitability of plant samples and soil leachates from the IRHUM database (www.irhumdatabase.com) to create a bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr map using a novel geostatistical framework. First, we generated an 87Sr/86Sr map by classifying 87Sr/86Sr values into five geologically-representative isotope groups using cluster analysis. The isotope groups were then used as a covariate in kriging to integrate prior geological knowledge of Sr cycling with the information contained in the bioavailable dataset and enhance 87Sr/86Sr predictions. Our approach couples the strengths of classification and geostatistical methods to generate more accurate 87Sr/86Sr predictions (Root Mean Squared Error = 0.0029) with an estimate of spatial uncertainty based on lithology and sample density. This bioavailable Sr isoscape is applicable for provenance studies in France, and the method is transferable to other areas with high sampling density. While our method is a step forward in generating accurate 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, the remaining uncertainty also demonstrates that fine-modelling of 87Sr/86Sr variability is challenging and requires more than geological maps for accurately predicting 87Sr/86Sr variations across the landscape. Future efforts should focus on increasing sampling density and developing predictive models to further quantify and predict the processes that lead to 87Sr/86Sr variability.},

This area is lightly populated and has a relatively simple groundwater system in that the only input of water is from precipitation and the dominant output of water is stream runoff with minor subsurface flow discharge to the sea. Forty-one samples of precipitation, throughfall, plants, soil, soil water, surface water and ground water collected during the calendar year 1991 were analyzed for strontium concentration and isotope composition. Our results suggest that soil weathering probably makes only a small contribution to the total Sr input. Dry precipitation accounts for approximately 90\% of the total Sr input to the system with wet precipitation supplying the other 10. Biomass and adsorbed Sr on the surface of soil particles at shallow depth are the two major reservoirs of Sr and hold more than 90\% of the Sr in the system. The estimated residence time for Sr within this system is approximately 50 years.},

Fitness is maximized by different strategies depending on context, resulting in trade-offs between life history strategies. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) employ both migratory and resident life history strategies. Since residents breed throughout the year, but migrants overwinter in reproductive diapause, there are fitness trade-offs between the two strategies. We used stable isotope analysis to evaluate the geographic origins of monarchs in a yearround population in south Florida. Based on stable isotope profiles of hydrogen and carbon (δ 2 H and δ 13 C values), we found that 48\% (16/33) of monarchs collected in south Florida are migrants that originated from outside the sampling region. Migrants had a larger wing length than residents; thus, switching to a resident strategy could alter their probability of reproductive success. Further work is needed to investigate the mechanism underlying this pattern, but these findings show that alternate life history strategies and sex-specific behaviors are underexplored factors influencing monarch migration and evolution.},

This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes.

	abstract = {Hill numbers (or the “effective number of species”) are increasingly used to characterize species diversity of an assemblage. This work extends Hill numbers to incorporate species pairwise functional distances calculated from species traits. We derive a parametric class of functional Hill numbers, which quantify “the effective number of equally abundant and (functionally) equally distinct species” in an assemblage. We also propose a class of mean functional diversity (per species), which quantifies the effective sum of functional distances between a fixed species to all other species. The product of the functional Hill number and the mean functional diversity thus quantifies the (total) functional diversity, i.e., the effective total distance between species of the assemblage. The three measures (functional Hill numbers, mean functional diversity and total functional diversity) quantify different aspects of species trait space, and all are based on species abundance and species pairwise functional distances. When all species are equally distinct, our functional Hill numbers reduce to ordinary Hill numbers. When species abundances are not considered or species are equally abundant, our total functional diversity reduces to the sum of all pairwise distances between species of an assemblage. The functional Hill numbers and the mean functional diversity both satisfy a replication principle, implying the total functional diversity satisfies a quadratic replication principle. When there are multiple assemblages defined by the investigator, each of the three measures of the pooled assemblage (gamma) can be multiplicatively decomposed into alpha and beta components, and the two components are independent. The resulting beta component measures pure functional differentiation among assemblages and can be further transformed to obtain several classes of normalized functional similarity (or differentiation) measures, including N-assemblage functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn and Morisita-Horn similarity indices. The proposed measures are applied to artificial and real data for illustration.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope analysis has proven useful in geo-location investigations of organic and inorganic materials and may complement the region-of-origin information provided by hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis. In this study, we analyzed 99 drinking (tap) water samples collected from 95 municipal water systems across the USA to investigate the potential that 87Sr/86Sr can be used to provenance samples from managed hydrological systems. Results from a leaching and exchange experiment demonstrated that non-ideal storage conditions did not prohibit Sr isotope analysis of previously archived water samples stored in glass. Tap water samples were analyzed via multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, which was preceded by a novel, automated, in-line Sr purification method. Measured tap water 87Sr/86Sr was compared to expected 87Sr/86Sr for collection location, which was predicted using four published isotope landscape (isoscape) models: age of bedrock (bedrock model), age plus major and minor lithology of bedrock (major bedrock model), weathering of Sr from rock (local water model), and surface fluxes within watershed (catchment model). The geologic history of the geographic regions represented by collected tap waters was diverse and we therefore expected significant covariation in measured and modeled 87Sr/86Sr values. Tap water exhibited large ranges in both Sr concentration (0–1.9 mg/L) and 87Sr/86Sr (0.7037–0.7320). Measured tap water 87Sr/86Sr ratios were significantly and positively correlated with predictions based on bedrock and catchment models. However, these bedrock and catchment models explained relatively little of the tap water Sr isotopic variation (;10\% and 17\%, respectively), suggesting that the factors affecting drinking water 87Sr/86Sr are complex and more numerous than the variables included in current water models. This could be due to the reliance of some municipal water systems on groundwater, rather than surficial water sources; the natural movement of water across distinct geologic gradients; and/or the managed transport of water from source to point-of-use. Although published isoscape models for predicting Sr isotopic variation within the continental USA are reasonable approaches for estimating surface water 87Sr/86Sr, additional efforts are needed to develop a prediction model specifically for tap water 87Sr/86Sr.},

	abstract = {Selective pressures that occur during long-distance migration can influence morphological traits across a range of taxa. In flying insects, selection should favour individuals that have wing morphologies that increase energy efficiency and survival. In monarch butterflies, differences in wing morphology between migratory and resident populations suggest that migratory populations have undergone selection for larger (as measured by length and area) and more elongated (as measured by roundness and aspect ratio) forewings. However, selection on wing morphology may also occur within migratory populations, particularly if individuals or populations consistently migrate different distances. Using 613 monarch butterflies that were collected on the Mexican wintering grounds between 1976 – 2014, we tested whether monarch wing traits were associated with migratory distance from their natal areas in eastern North America (migration range: 774–4430 km), as inferred by stable-hydrogen (δ
                           2H) and -carbon (δ
                           13C) isotopic measurements. Monarchs that migrated farther distances to reach their overwintering sites tended to have longer and larger wings, suggesting positive selective pressure during migration on wing length and area. There was no relationship between migration distances and either roundness or aspect ratio. Our results provide correlative evidence that the migratory period may act as a selective episode on monarch butterfly wing morphology, although selection during other portions of the annual cycle, as well as extensive mixing of individuals from various natal locations on the breeding grounds, likely counteracts directional selection of migration on morphology.},

	abstract = {Rainwater plays a major role in determining the transfer of elements and pollutants to soils and hydrological catchments, with compositional variations reflecting the extent of mixing between marine (sea-salt), terrestrial (dust and vegetation) and anthropogenic aerosols. While the radiogenic strontium isotope system (87Sr/86Sr) is often used to help constrain the different sources of atmospheric Sr, the degree of variability in the stable strontium isotope system (δ88/86Sr) remains unresolved. In order to determine how atmospheric Sr affects the δ88/86Sr composition of water entering the hydrological cycle this study analysed a suite of rainwater samples collected over the course of a year in central Paris. Rainwater δ88/86Sr compositions were found to range from 0.13‰ to 0.32‰, with 87Sr/86Sr ratios varying between 0.70796 and 0.71093. No seasonality was observed in δ88/86Sr, whereas 87Sr/86Sr ratios were observed to be generally more radiogenic in the summer and less radiogenic in the winter. Strontium enrichment factors significantly above seawater implied a predominantly terrestrial (non-sea-salt) origin of Sr in rainwater, with the δ88/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr composition of this terrestrial fraction consistent with a mixture of Sr derived from carbonate dust and agricultural fertiliser. Evidence for a {\textasciitilde}0.1‰ decrease in the δ88/86Sr composition of the River Seine as it passes through Paris suggests that anthropogenic pollutants may contribute to significant regional variations in the composition of Sr in the hydrological cycle. Together these results demonstrate that there is significant potential for both temporal and spatial variations in the δ88/86Sr and 87Sr/86Sr composition of rainwater that need to be taken into consideration when studying δ88/86Sr variations in localised catchments.},

We find that engagement with narratives of beauty, natural wonder, scientific discovery, conservation imperatives, and civic duty has allowed the monarch to enroll actors in a broad network that gives rise to surprising, emergent properties. These properties make the monarch a powerful communication vehicle and a potent ally in environmental politics. Our analysis of the historical and contemporary construction of the monarch as an icon contributes to ongoing efforts to bring resources from critical social science to bear on the strengthening of science-policy–practice interfaces.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) are gaining considerable interest as a geolocation tool and are now widely applied in archaeology, ecology, and forensic research. However, their application for provenance requires the development of baseline models predicting surficial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations ("isoscapes"). A variety of empirically-based and process-based models have been proposed to build terrestrial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isoscapes but, in their current forms, those models are not mature enough to be integrated with continuous-probability surface models used in geographic assignment. In this study, we aim to overcome those limitations and to predict 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations across Western Europe by combining process-based models and a series of remote-sensing geospatial products into a regression framework. We find that random forest regression significantly outperforms other commonly used regression and interpolation methods, and efficiently predicts the multi-scale patterning of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations by accounting for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. Random forest regression also provides an easily interpretable and flexible framework to integrate different types of environmental auxiliary variables required to model the multi-scale pattern-ing of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variability. The method is transferable to different scales and resolutions and can be applied to the large collection of geospatial data available at local and global levels. The isoscape generated in this study provides the most accurate 87 Sr/ 86 Sr predictions in bioavailable strontium for Western Europe (R 2 = 0.58 and RMSE = 0.0023) to date, as well as a conservative estimate of spatial uncertainty by applying quantile regression forest. We anticipate that the method presented in this study combined with the growing numbers of bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr data and satellite geospatial products will extend the applicability of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr geo-profiling tool in provenance applications.},

	abstract = {Abiotic change can alter species interactions by modifying species' trophic roles, but this has not been well studied. Until now, bromeliad-dwelling tipulid larvae were thought to positively affect other macroinvertebrates via a facilitative processing chain. However, under drought, we found the opposite. We performed two microcosm experiments in which we factorially manipulated water level and predation by tipulids, and measured the effects on mosquito and chironomid larvae. The experiments differed in whether high water was contrasted with low or no water, allowing us to distinguish between the effects of desiccation stress (no water) and increased encounter rates due to compression of habitat or reductions in prey mobility (low and no water). We also included a caged tipulid treatment to measure any non-consumptive effects. As well as directly reducing prey survival, reductions in water level indirectly decreased chironomid and mosquito survival by altering the trophic role of tipulids. Our results suggest that increased encounter rates with prey led to tipulids becoming predatory under simulated drought, as tipulids consumed prey under both low and no water. When water level was high, tipulids exerted negative non-consumptive effects on prey survival. Because opportunistic predators are common throughout aquatic ecosystems, the effects of drought on the trophic roles of species may be widespread. Such restructuring of food webs should be considered when attempting to predict the ecological effects of environmental change.},

Here, we use museum and herbaria specimens to extend our knowledge of the dynamics of both monarchs and milkweeds in the United States to more than a century, from 1900 to 2016. We show that both monarchs and milkweeds increased during the early 20th century and that recent declines are actually part of a much longer-term decline in both monarchs and milkweed beginning around 1950. Herbicide-resistant crops, therefore, are clearly not the only culprit and, likely, not even the primary culprit: Not only did monarch and milkweed declines begin decades before GM crops were introduced, but other variables, particularly a decline in the number of farms, predict common milkweed trends more strongly over the period studied here.},

	volume = {44},
	abstract = {Insects, like most other organisms, are more diverse in tropical than in temperate regions, but standardized comparisons of diversity among tropical regions are rare. Disentangling the effects of ecological, evolutionary, and biogeographic factors on community diversity requires standardized protocols and long-term studies. We compared the abundance and diversity of butterflies using standardised 'Pollard walk' transect counts in the understory of closed-canopy lowland rainforests in Panama (Barro Colorado Island, BCI), Thailand (Khao Chong, KHC) and Papua New Guinea (Wanang, WAN). We observed 1792, 1797 and 3331 butterflies representing 128, 131 and 134 species during 230, 231 and 120 transects at BCI, KHC and WAN, respectively. When corrected for length and duration of transects, butterfly abundance and species richness were highest at WAN and KHC, respectively. Although high butterfly abundance at WAN did not appear to result from methodological artefacts, the biological meaning of this observation remains obscure. The WAN site appeared as floristically diverse as KHC, but supported lower butterfly diversity. This emphasizes that factors other than plant diversity, such as biogeographic history, may be crucial for explaining butterfly diversity. The KHC butterfly fauna may be unusually species rich because the site is at a biogeographic crossroads between the Indochinese and Sundaland regions. In contrast, WAN is firmly within the Australian biogeographic region and relatively low species numbers may result from island biogeographic processes. The common species at each of the three sites shared several traits: fruit and nectar feeders were equally represented, more than half of common species fed on either epiphytes or lianas as larvae, and their range in wing sizes was similar. These observations suggest that Pollard walks in different tropical rainforests target similar assemblages of common species, and, hence, represent a useful tool for long-term monitoring of rainforest butterfly assemblages.},

It is still too often ignored that a population count results from two processes: the biological process (true abundance) and the statistical process (our ability to properly quantify abundance). Because individual detectability tends to vary in space (e.g., among sites) and time (e.g., among years), it remains unclear whether index counts truly reflect population sizes and trends. This study compares capture-mark-recapture (absolute abundance) and count-index (relative abundance) monitoring methods in three species (Maculinea nausithous and Iolana iolas: Lycaenidae; Minois dryas: Satyridae) in contrasted habitat types. We demonstrate that intraspecific variability in individual detectability under standard monitoring conditions is probably the rule rather than the exception, which questions the reliability of count-based indices to estimate and compare specific population abundance. Our results suggest that the accuracy of count-based methods depends heavily on the ecology and behavior of the target species, as well as on the type of habitat in which surveys take place. Monitoring programs designed to assess the abundance and trends in butterfly populations should incorporate a measure of detectability. We discuss the relative advantages and inconveniences of current monitoring methods and analytical approaches with respect to the characteristics of the species under scrutiny and resources availability.},

Changes in distribution and latitudinal/altitudinal range shift, which are primary adaptive responses to climate change in many species, are largely unknown due to unavailability of adequate data from the past. In this study, we explored the elevational distribution of butterflies in Langtang Village Development Committee (VDC) of Langtang National park; a park located in the high altitudes of Nepal. We found a decreasing species richness pattern along the elevational gradient considered here. Interestingly, elevation did not appear to have a significant effect on the altitudinal distribution of butterflies at family level. Also, distribution of butterflies in the area was independent of habitat type, at family level. Besides, we employed indicator group analysis (at family level) and noticed that butterfly families Papilionidae, Riodinidae, and Nymphalidae are significantly associated to high, medium and low elevational zone making them indicator butterfly family for those elevational zones, respectively. We expect that this study could serve as a baseline information for future studies regarding climate change effects and range shifts and provide avenues for further exploration of butterflies in the high altitudes of Nepal.},

In this paper, we traced the history of biodiversity research in the Kangchenjunga landscape, and present the research trends over time and subject interests. Meanwhile, we also identified key research and knowledge gaps and future priorities. For this, we analyzed 500 peer-reviewed journal articles (until 2014) relating to biodiversity, which were retrieved from the web platform 'Google Scholar' and other peer-reviewed journals. The review showed that the landscape received attention from the scientific community as early as the 1840s, and grew progressively after the 1980s. Research on fauna (especially mammals) and flora (especially angiosperms) is most notable, but with major gaps in systematic research of their ecology, whereas invertebrates other than butterflies appear to be neglected. There is a need for systematic research with long-term monitoring that would allow us to understand changes occurring within the landscape.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation has undergone a profound change in philosophy, policies and management approaches over the last forty years. The traditional top-down approach to nature protection has been widely criticized for failing to include critical social elements in management practices, and is being gradually replaced by a slew of participatory strategies under the rubric of bottom-up conservation. The new approach recognizes local communities as key partners in wildlife management and seeks their participation in social development and biodiversity conservation. However, every social context is different in its structure and functions, and in the way social groups respond to calls for participation. In order to gain a better understanding of the approach and the barriers encountered in its implementation, a questionnaire survey of 188 households was employed in the communities of the Upper Mustang extension of Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) in Nepal. The study provides a comparative analysis of community participation and its barriers between Non-Tourist (NT) and Tourist (TV) villages. The results revealed important differences between the two groups in terms of their participation in community programs, barriers to participation, and perception of benefits from participation. Owing to their distinct spatial, demographic and attitudinal differences, the two village groups have their own sets of needs, values and motivation factors which cannot be generalized and treated as such. The research clearly identifies the need for the conservation agency to be creative in devising strategies and initiatives appropriate to specific social groups so as to optimize their input in par-ticipatory conservation.},

	abstract = {Tourism is Nepal's largest industry, giving people in rural areas an alternative to subsistence farming. Tourism can have an impact on the forest cover of a region as trees provide firewood for cooking and heating and timber for building accommodation. In 1986 the Annapurna Conservation Area Project was established to ensure that tourism was managed more sustainably, which includes minimising its impact on the forest cover. This study assesses the impacts of tourism on the forest cover in the Annapurna region by comparing Landsat images from 1999 to 2011. This was achieved through spectral classification of different land cover and by assessing the change in forest cover in relation to increasing distances from tourism villages. A major problem with remote sensing in mountainous regions such as Nepal is shadow caused by the relief. This issue was addressed by only assessing areas which were free from shadow, which in effect meant a sample was used rather than the whole study region. The results indicate that there has been an 8 percent reduction in overall forest extent, but this change varies by region. In the northern, drier regions there has been a net increase in forest cover, while in the southern regions there has been a net reduction in forests. The influence of tourism facilities on forest is also variable. Around each of the tourism villages sampled there was a general trend of forest removal decreasing as the distance from each village increased, which indicates tourism does have a negative impact on forests. However, there was an opposite trend in the northern villages that were well inside the conservation area.},

	abstract = {The geographic ranges of many species have shifted polewards and uphill in elevation associated with climate warming, leading to increases in species richness at high latitudes and elevations. However, few studies have addressed community-level responses to climate change across the entire elevational gradients of mountain ranges, or at warm lower latitudes where ecological diversity is expected to decline. Here, we show uphill shifts in butterfly species richness and composition in the Sierra de Guadarrama (central Spain) between 1967-1973 and 2004-2005. Butterfly communities with comparable species compositions shifted uphill by 293 m (AE SE 26), consistent with an upward shift of approximately 225 m in mean annual isotherms. Species richness had a humped relationship with elevation, but declined between surveys, particularly at low elevations. Changes to species richness and composition primarily reflect the loss from lower elevations of species whose regional distributions are restricted to the mountains. The few colonizations by specialist low-elevation species failed to compensate for the loss of high-elevation species, because there are few low-elevation species in the region and the habitat requirements of some of these prevent them from colonizing the mountain range. As a result, we estimated a net decline in species richness in approximately 90\% of the region, and increasing community domination by widespread species. The results suggest that climate warming, combined with habitat loss and other drivers of biological change, could lead to significant losses in ecological diversity in mountains and other regions where species encounter their lower latitudinal-range margins.},

Of course multi-collector mass spectrometers are required which offer sufficiently high isotope ratio precision for the intended research work. Following this, corrections for mass fractionation/discrimination, validation of the analytical procedure including chemical sample preparation and complete uncertainty budgets are the most important issues for obtaining a metrologically valid procedure for isotope ratio determination. Only the application of such metrologically valid procedures enables the generation of traceable and comparable isotope data. To realize this suitable isotope and/or δ-reference materials are required, which currently are not sufficiently available for most isotope systems. Boron is given as an example, for which the situation regarding isotope and δ-reference materials is excellent. Boron may therefore serve as prototype for other isotope systems.},

	abstract = {Strontium (Sr) isotope analysis can provide detailed biogeographical and ecological information about modern and ancient organisms. Because Sr isotope ratios (87 Sr/86 Sr) in biologically relevant materials such as water, soil, vegetation, and animal tissues predominantly reflect local geology, they can be used to distinguish geologically distinct regions as well as identify highly mobile individuals or populations. While the application of Sr isotope analysis to biological research has been steadily increasing, high analytical costs have prohibited more widespread use. Additionally, accessibility of this geochemical tool has been hampered due to limited understanding of (i) the degree to which biologically relevant materials differ in their spatial averaging of 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios, and (ii) how these differences may be affected by lithologic complexity. A recently developed continental-scale model that accounts for variability in bedrock weathering rates and predicts Sr isotope ratios of surface water could help resolve these questions. In addition, if this 'local water' model can accurately predict 87 Sr/86 Sr ratios for other biologically relevant materials, there would be reduced need for researchers to assess regional Sr isotope patterns empirically. Here, we compile 87 Sr/86 Sr data for surface water, soil, vegetation, and mammalian and fish skeletal tissues from the literature and compare the accuracy with which the local water model predicts Sr isotope data among these five materials across the contiguous USA. We find that measured Sr isotope ratios for all five materials are generally close to those predicted by the local water model, although not with uniform accuracy. Mammal skeletal tissues are most accurately predicted, particularly in regions with low variability in 87 Sr/86 Sr predicted by the local water model. Increasing regional geologic heterogeneity increases both the offset and variance between modelled and empirical Sr isotope ratios, but its effects are broadly similar across materials. The local water model thus provides a readily available source of background data for predicting 87 Sr/86 Sr for biologically relevant materials in places where empirical data are lacking. The availability of increasingly high-quality modelled Sr data will dramatically expand the accessibility of this geochemical tool to ecological applications.},

We conducted a species distribution modeling exercise using MaxEnt to model milkweed species and common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) presence in natural areas and ditches throughout northwest Ohio in order to identify which local or regional landscape attributes most strongly influence milkweed presence. We found that while natural areas and ditches have similar presence probability ranges (milkweed: natural areas 3–98\% and ditches 1–98\%; common milkweed: natural areas and ditches 0–98\%), natural areas have a higher average probability of presence than ditches (milkweed: natural areas = 30 ± 26\% and ditches = 7 ± 7\%; common milkweed: natural areas = 22 ± 2...},

	abstract = {Road mortality may contribute to the population decline of eastern monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus L.). We estimated autumn monarch roadkill rates within the primary Oklahoma to Mexico southern migration corridor (i.e., Central Funnel). Dead monarchs were surveyed along Texas roadsides during four weeks of autumn migration in 2016 and 2017. Roadkill averaged 3.4 monarchs per 100 m transect, reaching 66 per 100 m in a roadkill hotspot in southwestern Texas. Extrapolations of Central Funnel roadkill based on survey data and road types were 3.6 and 1.1 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Spatial distribution of roadkill across the Central Funnel was projected from Texas survey data using 30 m resolution MaxEnt niche models. Highest roadkill probability was linked to arid climate and low human population density. The latter variables may not be directly related to roadkill, but instead represent indirect correlates of increased densities of monarchs where the migration corridor narrows southwards. The higher roadkill projected in southwest Texas and Mexico by MaxEnt models agrees with previously reported monarch roadkill hotspots. MaxEnt-based 2016–2017 projections for annual roadkill rates throughout the Central Funnel averaged 2.1 million. This figure is similar to the result by simple extrapolation, and represents about 3\% of the overwintering monarch population for these years. Mitigation at roadkill hotspots in the Central Funnel could reduce monarch roadkill mortality during migration and contribute towards conservation efforts for the monarch butterfly.},

	title = {Natal origins of migratory monarch butterflies at wintering colonies in {Mexico}: {New} isotopic evidence},
	volume = {95},
	abstract = {Each year, millions of monarch butterf lies from eastern North America migrate to overwinter in 10-13 discrete colonies located in the Oyamel forests of central Mexico. For decades efforts to track monarch migration have relied on observations and tag-recapture methods, culminating with the discovery of the wintering colonies in 1975. Monarch tag returns from Mexico, however, are few and primarily from two accessible colonies, and therefore tag-recapture techniques have not quantified natal origins or distinctiveness among monarch populations at wintering sites. Such information would be invaluable in the conservation of the monarch and its migration phenomenon since the wintering sites currently are threatened by habitat alteration. Here we show that stable hydrogen (D) and carbon (13 C) isotope ratios of wintering monarchs can be used to evaluate natal origins on the summer breeding range. Stable-hydrogen and carbon isotopic values of 597 wintering monarchs from 13 wintering roost sites were compared with isotopic patterns measured in individuals at natal sites across their breeding range over a single migration cycle. We determined that all monarch wintering colonies were composed of individuals originating mainly from the Midwest, United States, thereby providing evidence for a panmictic model of wintering colony composition. However, two colonies showed more northerly origins, suggesting possible priority colonies for conservation efforts. More than 100 million monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate annually from eastern North America to overwinter in 10-13 discrete (2 ha) colonies located in remote Oyamel forests of central Mexico (refs. 1-6; Fig. 1). Monarchs returning to these wintering sites are separated by several generations from those that left the previous year, yet the same overwin-tering locations are used every year. Although monarch migration has been studied for more than 50 years (1, 6), how butterflies navigate to these locations from specific areas in North America (7) and whether colony composition is pan-mictic have long been mysteries. Previously, monarch migration to Mexico has been studied by using tag-recapture techniques, which involves the placement of small identification tags on monarchs captured and released in the breeding range (ref. 3; Monarch Watch Organization , University of Kansas, http:MonarchWatch.org). Hundreds of thousands of monarchs have been tagged over the past five decades, with only 125 recoveries from Mexico occurring since 1975 (Monarch Watch Organization, University of Kansas, http:MonarchWatch.org). Most (83\%) tags recovered between 1975 and 1998 were found at colonies with public viewing or research access (El Rosario and Sierra Chincua), with few or no tags recovered from the remaining 11-12 remote sites (Monarch Watch Organization, University of Kansas, http:MonarchWatch.org). Other difficulties include the fact that most tagged migrants are recaptured within the breeding range, and the number of individuals tagged does not reflect monarch production in any given area. Thus, tagging has not yielded quantitative information on proportions of monarchs originating from various parts of the breeding range. Clearly, a better tool is needed to assess the origins of wintering monarchs in Mexico. Such knowledge is required to focus conservation efforts in critical portions of the North American breeding range and at wintering sites in Mexico. Based on laboratory and extensive field-rearing experiments across the eastern breeding range we showed that the stable-hydrogen (D) and carbon (13 C) isotopic composition of adult monarch wing membranes closely resembles, and permanently records, the isotopic composition of its natal (larval) food source (15). The isotopic composition of the monarch larval milkweed host plant (Asclepia sp.) is, in turn, controlled by continental isotopic patterns in rainfall for D (8, 15) and other climatic and physiological factors for 13 C (8, 9). The D and 13 C values of adult monarch wings from natal sites show isotopic trends across eastern North America, with increasingly depleted D values found toward the northerly limits of the breeding range and 13 C enrichment toward more northerly latitudes (15) (Fig. 2). These results show that natural signals of D and 13 C are intrinsic markers of natal origins of monarchs. By sampling and measuring the isotopic composition of wintering monarchs in Mexico, we reasoned that it should be possible to infer their geographic natal origins and to establish whether wintering colonies are composed of monarchs from different regions. METHODS We measured D and 13 C values of 597 monarch butterflies collected from natural mortality at 13 wintering colonies (44-50 per colony) during February of 1997 (Table 1). These were individuals that migrated from North America in late summer and fall of 1996, and so could be related directly back to our 1996 breeding range isotopic study (15) (Fig. 2). Fifty male and 50 females were taken at random from each colony and stored in paper envelopes. Monarch wing membranes were separated from the abdomen, placed in glass vials, solvent-cleaned, air-dried, and stored. Because a portion of the total hydrogen of monarch wing membrane (largely keratin) is available for isotopic exchange with ambient water vapor, it was necessary to quantify and eliminate the effect of this uncontrolled, temperature-dependent variable. Unfortunately, complete elimination of exchangeable hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen involved in OOH bonds) by chemical techniques such as nitration is not possible for complex organic matter (10).

The frequency and timing of these events could be influenced by the impact of climate change on the suitability of the different sites exploited throughout the year, yet, in many cases, little is known about the origin of seasonal populations, as tracking insect movements is extremely challenging due to their small body size. 2. The use of stable isotope measurements in insect tissues combined with the development of tissue-specific 'isoscapes' of modelled geographic isotope patterns presents a potentially valuable but rarely used approach for obtaining such information on important pest species. In this paper it is illustrated how stable hydrogen isotope analyses (í µí»¿ 2 H) in wing chitin of the true armyworm (Mythimna (Psuedaletia) unipuncta Haworth), a seasonal migrant, clearly delineated between 2016 spring immigrants and later locally produced moths in southern Ontario, Canada. 3. It is shown that adult moths captured in early fall in Texas were immigrants from farther north, the first direct confirmation of a southward return migration of this species. Stable carbon isotope (í µí»¿ 13 C) measurements indicated that spring immigrants in Ontario and autumn immigrants in Texas were from exclusively C3 biomes. Stable nitrogen isotope (í µí»¿ 15 N) measurements also provided information on the probability of individuals coming from agriculturally intensive (i.e. higher í µí»¿ 15 N) sites.

History has shown us that without these data, conservation decisions often weaken, rather than enhance, population viability. This is especially true in changing landscapes. We review knowledge of vital rates across all at-risk butterflies. We have information on movement for 17 of 283 butterfly species and information on demography for 19 species. We find that habitat-specific movement behavior is key to understanding how to connect populations, and habitat-specific demography is central to managing habitats.

	abstract = {Animal migration is an amazing phenomenon that has fascinated humans for long. Many freshwater fishes also show remarkable migrations, whereof the spectacular mass migrations of salmonids from the spawning streams are the most well known and well studied. However, recent studies have shown that migration occurs in a range of freshwater fish taxa from many different habitats. In this review we focus on the causes and consequences of migration in freshwater fishes. We start with an introduction of concepts and categories of migration, and then address the evolutionary causes that drive individuals to make these migratory journeys. The basis for the decision of an individual fish to migrate or stay resident is an evaluation of the costs and benefits of different strategies to maximize its lifetime reproductive effort. We provide examples by discussing our own work on the causes behind seasonal migration in a cyprinid fish, roach (Rutilus rutilus (L., 1758)), within this framework. We then highlight different adaptations that allow fish to migrate over sometimes vast journeys across space, including capacity for orientation, osmoregulation, and efficient energy expenditure. Following this we consider the consequences of migration in freshwater fish from ecological, evolutionary, and conservation perspectives , and finally, we detail some of the recent developments in the methodologies used to collect data on fish migration and how these could be used in future research. Résumé : L'étonnant phénomène des migrations animales fascine les humains depuis belle lurette. De remarquables migrations caractérisent de nombreux poissons d'eau douce, les migrations massives des salmonidés a ` partir de leur cours d'eau d'origine étant les plus connues et les plus étudiées. Cela dit, des études récentes ont démontré l'existence de migrations chez divers taxons de poissons dulcicoles d'habitats nombreux et variés. Dans la présente synthèse, nous nous penchons sur les causes et conséquences de la migration chez les poissons dulcicoles. Nous abordons en premier lieu les concepts importants et les catégories de migration, puis examinons les causes évolutionnaires qui amènent des individus a ` accomplir ces déplacements migratoires. La décision d'un poisson donné de migrer ou de demeurer en place repose sur une évaluation des coûts et avantages de différentes stratégies visant a ` optimiser son effort de reproduction durant sa durée de vie. Nous présentons des exemples basés sur nos propres travaux sur les causes de la migration saisonnière chez un poisson cyprinidé, le gardon (Rutilus rutilus (L., 1758)), dans ce cadre. Nous décrivons ensuite différentes adaptations qui permettent dans certains cas a ` des poissons de migrer sur de grandes distances, dont une capacité d'orientation, l'osmorégulation et l'efficience des dépenses énergétiques. Nous examinons ensuite les conséquences de la migration chez les poissons dulcicoles des points de vue écologique, évolutionnaire et de la conservation, pour finalement aborder certaines avancées méthodologiques récentes dans la collecte de données sur la migration des poissons et leur utilisation dans le cadre de travaux futurs.

In some cases, migration lowers pathogen transmission by removing infected individuals during strenuous journeys and allowing animals to periodically escape contaminated habitats. Human activities are now causing some migratory animals to travel shorter distances or form sedentary (non-migratory) populations. We focused on North American monarch butterflies and a specialist protozoan parasite to investigate how the loss of migratory behaviours affects pathogen spread and evolution. Each autumn, monarchs migrate from breeding grounds in the eastern US and Canada to wintering sites in central Mexico. However, some monarchs have become non-migratory and breed year-round on exotic milkweed in the southern US. We used field sampling, citizen science data and experimental inoculations to quantify infection prevalence and parasite virulence among migratory and sedentary populations. Infection prevalence was markedly higher among sedentary monarchs compared with migratory monarchs, indicating that diminished migration increases infection risk. Virulence differed among parasite strains but was similar between migratory and sedentary populations, potentially owing to high gene flow or insufficient time for evolutionary divergence. More broadly, our findings suggest that human activities that alter animal migrations can influence pathogen dynamics, with implications for wildlife conservation and future disease risks.},

Here, we examine a little-studied aspect of monarch biology, the degree of overwintering in the southern United States. We compiled 9 years of sightings of overwintering monarchs in the southern United States that were reported to Journey North, a web-based citizen science program, to map the distribution of areas where monarchs are capable of surviving during the winter (i.e., in January and February), differentiating between adult sightings and sightings of breeding activity. We also statistically compared the latitudes of adult and breeding sightings, examined differences across years in latitude of sightings, and quantified the number of monarchs reported with each sighting. Of all 254 sightings, 80\% came from Florida and Texas, with the remainder coming from South Carolina, Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina, and even one in Virginia. This distribution was generally consistent with the winter range predicted by prior investigators based on climatic conditions of this region. Sightings of adults were on average from higher latitudes than reports of breeding activity and there was significant variation across years in the average latitude of all sightings. The majority of sightings (94.2\%) were of fewer than 10 adult monarchs per location, and there were no reports of clustering behavior that is typical of monarch overwintering in California and Mexico. The results of this investigation broaden our collective understanding of this stage of the monarch life cycle and, more generally, highlight the value of citizen science programs in advancing science.},

We term these links between breeding and nonbreeding areas 'migratory connectivity'. The concept of migratory connectivity is distinct from other concepts of connectivity in ecology (Box 1). Moreover, migratory connectivity can be weak (diffuse) or strong, depending on the degree to which individuals from different nonbreeding areas mix during the breeding season and vice versa (Box 2). It is generally, if somewhat implicitly, recognized that migratory connectivity has important consequences for the ecology, evolution and conservation of migratory organisms. This recognition has led to massive mark-recapture efforts in which millions of birds have been ringed. In spite of such efforts, we still have a poor understanding of migratory connectivity for most bird species, and we do not know where individual birds from high latitudes spend their winter or vice versa. Do the individuals that comprise a single breeding population all migrate to the same nonbreeding location, or do they spread out over the entire nonbreeding range of the species? This lack of understanding has a simple underlying basis: the geographical areas and numbers of individuals involved are huge, but the organisms themselves are small. Thus, the probability of identifying, on the nonbreeding grounds, a bird that was ringed on the breeding grounds is very low. This frustrating situation could soon be resolved. Exciting new advances in remote sensing, the analysis of molecular genetic markers and chemical isotopes offer a level of resolution that was not available previously. By integrating these new advances, we might be on the brink of addressing the vexing issue of migratory connectivity and its biological consequences. Here, we describe some theoretical implications of migratory connectivity for ecology, evolution and conservation, and review recent technological advances and their application to the study of migratory birds. These techniques can be applied to the study of other migratory organisms [2], and our hope is that this review will stimulate further research on the consequences of migratory connectivity. Why is it important to understand migratory connectivity? Migratory individuals spend different periods of their annual cycle in widely separated and ecologically disparate locations. It is now clear that these periods are inextricably linked [3-5], and that the biological phenomena observed are the result of a complex set of interactions occurring over this space and time continuum. To understand the biology of any animal, resident or migratory, we need to consider how events in different stages of the annual cycle interact and influence subsequent events at the level of the individual and, eventually, the population. Individual reproductive success and population dynamics Fretwell [6] provided convincing theoretical arguments that the population dynamics of organisms living in seasonal environments result from interactions of events between those seasons. He argued that breeding densities are determined, in part, by winter survival, and that winter survival is related to events that occurred during the previous breeding season. The essential idea is that individuals carry over effects from one season to the next, and that these residual effects, such as physical condition or date of arrival [5], can explain important variation in reproductive success and/or annual survival. Although intuitively appealing, it has proved difficult to determine whether Fretwell's seasonal interaction arguments also pertain to migratory species, owing, in large part, to the difficulties of tracking populations or individuals between different phases of the annual cycle. Recently, Marra et al. [3] explored these ideas in migratory songbirds using stable isotopes. They showed that winter habitat quality determined both timing of spring migration and physical condition at departure, which in turn influenced arrival time and physical condition in the breeding season. These effects probably influence individual reproductive Migration is the regular seasonal movement of animals from one place to another, often from a breeding site to a nonbreeding site and back. Because the act of migration makes it difficult to follow individuals and populations year round, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of migrating organisms, particularly birds, has been severely impeded. Exciting new advances in satellite telemetry, genetic analyses and stable isotope chemistry are now making it possible to determine the population and geographical origin of individual birds. Here, we review these new approaches and consider the relevance of understanding migratory connectivity to ecological, evolutionary and conservation issues.},

	doi = {10.1007/s12080-009-0054-4},
	abstract = {Migratory animals are comprised of a complex series of interconnected breeding and nonbreeding populations. Because individuals in any given population can arrive from a variety of sites the previous season, predicting how different populations will respond to environmental change can be challenging. In this study, we develop a population model composed of a network of breeding and wintering sites to show how habitat loss affects patterns of connectivity and species abundance. When the costs of migration are evenly distributed, habitat loss at a single site can increase the degree of connectivity (mixing) within the entire network, which then acts to buffer global populations from declines. However, the degree to which populations are buffered depends on where habitat loss occurs within the network: a site that has the potential to receive individuals from multiple populations in the opposite season will lead to smaller declines than a site that is more isolated. In other cases when there are equal costs of migration to two or more sites in the opposite season, habitat loss can result in some populations becoming segregated (discon-nected) from the rest of the network. The geographic structure of the network can have a significant influence on relative population sizes of sites in the same season and can also affect the overall degree of mixing in the network, even when sites are of equal intrinsic quality. When a migratory network is widely spaced and migration costs are high, an equivalent habitat loss will lead to a larger decline in global population size than will occur in a network where the overall costs of migration are low. Our model provides an important foundation to test predictions related to habitat loss in real-world migratory networks and demonstrates that migratory networks will likely produce different dynamics from traditional metapopulations. Our results provide strong evidence that estimating population connectivity is a prerequisite for successfully predicting changes in migratory populations.},

	abstract = {Europe 2010 Target A B S T R A C T We present the first continent-wide analysis of the population trends of European breeding birds to show that populations of Afro-Palearctic migrant birds have shown a pattern of sustained, often severe, decline. The mean trend of inter-continental migrants was significantly negative between 1970 and 1990 and non-significantly so between 1990 and 2000. Mean population trends were positively correlated between periods, suggesting little change in the trajectory of most migrant species' populations over this 30-year period. In both periods, trends of inter-continental migrants were significantly more negative than those of short-distance migrants or residents. This negative trend appeared to be largely, although not entirely, due to declines in species wintering in dry, open habitats in Africa. Analyses of trends of 30 closely related pairs of species, one a long-distance migrant and the other not, indicated significantly more negative trends in the former, irrespective of breeding habitat. Conservation action to address these declines is required under the Convention on Migratory Species and the Pan-European Biological and Landscape Diversity Strategy, to which most European countries are signatories and which aim, respectively, to conserve migratory species and to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010. Our results indicate that more conservation action may be required outside Europe to achieve these targets. Further research is needed to assess whether the declines are caused by factors operating on the birds' wintering grounds, breeding grounds or on migration routes, and to identify ways to reverse them.},

	abstract = {1. Migratory behaviour can result in reduced prevalence of pathogens in host populations. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this relationship: (i) 'migratory escape', where migrants benefit from escaping pathogen accumulation in contaminated environments; and (ii) 'migratory culling', where the selective removal of infected individuals occurs during migration. 2. In the host-parasite system between the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus Linn.) and its obligate protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), there is evidence to support both hypotheses, particularly during the monarchs' autumn migration. However, these processes can operate simultaneously and could vary throughout the monarchs' annual migratory cycle. Assessing the relative strength for each hypothesis has not previously been done. 3. To evaluate both hypotheses, parasite infection prevalence was examined in monarchs sampled in eastern North America during April-September, and stable isotopes (í µí»¿ 2 H, í µí»¿ 13 C) were used to estimate natal origin and infer migration distance. There was stronger support for the migratory escape hypothesis, wherein infection prevalence increased over the breeding season and was higher at southern latitudes, where the breeding season tends to be longer compared with northern latitudes. Little support was found for the migratory culling hypothesis, as infection prevalence was similar whether monarchs travelled shorter or longer distances. 4. These results suggest that migration allows individuals to escape parasites not only during the autumn, as shown in previous work, but during the monarchs' spring and summer movements when they recolonise the breeding range. These results imply a potential fitness advantage to monarchs that migrate further north to exploit parasite-free habitats.},

We performed a contingent valuation study of monarchs to understand the potential for such approaches to fund monarch conservation. The survey asked U.S. respondents about the money they would spend, or have spent, growing monarch-friendly plants, and the amount they would donate to monarch conservation organizations. Combining planting payments and donations, the survey indicated U.S. households valued monarchs as a total one-time payment of \$4.78-\$6.64 billion, levels similar to many endangered vertebrate species.

Using distribution models generated from citizen scientist occurrence data and stable-carbon and -hydrogen isotope measurements, we tracked multi-generational colonization of the breeding grounds of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America. We found that monarch breeding occurrence was best modelled with geographical and climatic variables resulting in an annual breeding distribution of greater than 12 million km(2) that encompassed 99\% occurrence probability. Combining occurrence models with stable isotope measurements to estimate natal origin, we show that butterflies which overwintered in Mexico came from a wide breeding distribution, including southern portions of the range. There was a clear northward progression of monarchs over successive generations from May until August when reproductive butterflies began to change direction and moved south. Fifth-generation individuals breeding in Texas in the late summer/autumn tended to originate from northern breeding areas rather than regions further south. Although the Midwest was the most productive area during the breeding season, monarchs that re-colonized the Midwest were produced largely in Texas, suggesting that conserving breeding habitat in the Midwest alone is insufficient to ensure long-term persistence of the monarch butterfly population in eastern North America.},

	abstract = {Threats to migratory animals can occur at multiple periods of the annual cycle that are separated by thousands of kilometers and span international borders. Populations of the iconic monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have declined over the last 21 years. Three hypotheses have been posed to explain the decline: habitat loss on the overwintering grounds in Mexico, habitat loss on the breeding grounds in the United States and Canada, and extreme weather events. Our objectives were to assess population viability, determine which life-stage, season and geographic region are contributing the most to population dynamics and test the three hypotheses that explain the observed population decline. We developed a spatially-structured, stochastic and density-dependent periodic projection matrix model that integrates patterns of migratory connectivity and demographic vital rates across the annual cycle. We used perturbation analysis to determine the sensitivity of population abundance to changes in vital rate among life-stages, seasons, and geographic regions. Next, we compared the singular effects of each threat to the full model where all factors operate concurrently. Finally, we generated predictions to assess the risk of host plant loss as a result of genetically modified crops on current and future monarch butterfly population size and extinction probability. Our year-round population model predicted population declines of 14\% and a quasi-extinction probability ({\textless}1000 individuals) greater than 5\% within a century. Monarch abundance was more than four times more sensitive to perturbations of vital rates on the breeding grounds than on the wintering grounds. Simulations that considered only forest loss or climate change in Mexico predicted higher population sizes compared to milkweed declines on the breeding grounds. Our model predictions also suggest that mitigating the negative effects of genetically modified crops results in higher population size and lower extinction risk. Recent population declines stem from reduction in milkweed host plants in the United States that arise from increasing adoption of genetically modified crops and land-use change, not from climate change or degradation of forest habitats in Mexico. Therefore, reducing the negative effects of host plant loss on the breeding grounds is the top conservation priority to slow or halt future population declines of monarch butterflies in North America.

	abstract = {Background. Migratory animals comprise a significant portion of biodiversity worldwide with annual investment for their conservation exceeding several billion dollars. Designing effective conservation plans presents enormous challenges. Migratory species are influenced by multiple events across land and sea-regions that are often separated by thousands of kilometres and span international borders. To date, conservation strategies for migratory species fail to take into account how migratory animals are spatially connected between different periods of the annual cycle (i.e. migratory connectivity) bringing into question the utility and efficiency of current conservation efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings. Here, we report the first framework for determining an optimal conservation strategy for a migratory species. Employing a decision theoretic approach using dynamic optimization, we address the problem of how to allocate resources for habitat conservation for a Neotropical-Nearctic migratory bird, the American redstart Setophaga ruticilla, whose winter habitat is under threat. Our first conservation strategy used the acquisition of winter habitat based on land cost, relative bird density, and the rate of habitat loss to maximize the abundance of birds on the wintering grounds. Our second strategy maximized bird abundance across the entire range of the species by adding the constraint of maintaining a minimum percentage of birds within each breeding region in North America using information on migratory connectivity as estimated from stable-hydrogen isotopes in feathers. We show that failure to take into account migratory connectivity may doom some regional populations to extinction, whereas including information on migratory connectivity results in the protection of the species across its entire range. Conclusions/ Significance. We demonstrate that conservation strategies for migratory animals depend critically upon two factors: knowledge of migratory connectivity and the correct statement of the conservation problem. Our framework can be used to identify efficient conservation strategies for migratory taxa worldwide, including insects, birds, mammals, and marine organisms.},

	abstract = {The demands of long-distance flight represent an important evolutionary force operating on the traits of migratory species. Monar- chs are widespread butterflies known for their annual migrations in North America. We examined divergence in wing morphology among migratory monarchs from eastern and western N. America, and nonmigratory monarchs in S. Florida, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Hawaii. For the three N. American populations, we also examined monarchs reared in four common environment experi- ments.We used image analysis to measure multiple traits including forewing area and aspect ratio; for laboratory-reared monarchs we also quantified body area and wing loading. Results showed wild monarchs from all nonmigratory populations were smaller than those from migratory populations. Wild and captive-reared eastern monarchs had the largest and most elongated forewings, whereas monarchs from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica had the smallest and roundest forewings. Eastern monarchs also had the largest bodies and high measures of wing loading, whereas western and S. Florida monarchs had less elongated forewings and smaller bodies. Among captive-reared butterflies, family-level effects provided evidence that genetic factors contributed to variation in wing traits. Collectively, these results support evolutionary responses to long-distance flight in monarchs, with implications for the conservation of phenotypically distinct wild populations.},

The two-stage strategy is based on a preliminary ranking of the explanatory variables using the random forests permutation-based score of importance and proceeds using a stepwise forward strategy for variable introduction. The two proposals can be obtained automatically using data-driven default values, good enough to provide interesting results, but strategy can also be tuned by the user.

A total of 30 butterfly species were observed; 27 (90\%) were recorded by Pollard walk observers, 18 (60\%) were found in Malaise traps, and 22 (73\%) were reported by iNaturalist observers. Pollard walks reported the highest butterfly species richness, followed by iNaturalist and then Malaise traps during the four-month time period. Pollard walks also had significantly higher species diversity than Malaise traps.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

	abstract = {As time and money is limited, explicit, cost-effective, quick, and appropriate methods are needed to assist conservation planners and managers for making quick decisions. Butterflies promise to be a good model for rapid assessment and habitat monitoring studies because they are widespread, conspicuous, and easily recognizable and they are effective indicators of forest health. We conducted a rapid assessment of butterflies at five disturbance gradient sites that varied in elevation from 900 m a.s.l. to 3500 m a.s.l. for 20 days during March-April 2010 and recorded 79 butterfly species and 1504 individuals in the Tons valley in Western Himalayas. We were able to sample approximately 77\% (123 species) of the estimated species richness on continuing the sampling until July 2010. Species richness at the study site is estimated to be 159 (95\% CI: 145-210) species. Diversity was highest in heterogeneous habitats and decreased towards homogeneous habitats. Unique species were highly restricted to lowest disturbed sites. Using Pearson's correlation analysis, the strongest vegetative predictors of butterfly richness were plant species richness, canopy cover, and herb and shrub density. Butterfly species richness and abundance were highly correlated with altitude, temperature , relative humidity, fire signs, and livestock abundance. We also found positive cross-taxon correlation among butterflies, moths, and beetles across sites, indicating that butterflies can be used as surrogate or indicator taxa for insect conservation. Short sampling periods providing comprehensive estimates of species richness were reliable for identifying habitats and sites with the most conservation value in the Tons valley landscape.},

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxo-nomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and midsummer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

	abstract = {A number of studies indicate that tropical arthropods should be particularly vulnerable to climate warming. If these predictions are realized, climate warming may have a more profound impact on the functioning and diversity of tropical forests than currently anticipated. Although arthropods comprise over two-thirds of terrestrial species, information on their abundance and extinction rates in tropical habitats is severely limited. Here we analyze data on arthropod and insectivore abundances taken between 1976 and 2012 at two midelevation habitats in Puerto Rico's Luquillo rainforest. During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthro-pods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo's insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds. While El Niño/Southern Oscillation influences the abundance of forest arthro-pods, climate warming is the major driver of reductions in arthropod abundance, indirectly precipitating a bottom-up trophic cascade and consequent collapse of the forest food web. climate warming {\textbar} rainforest {\textbar} food web {\textbar} arthropods {\textbar} bottom-up cascade},

	abstract = {Current practice in the normalization of microbiome count data is inefficient in the statistical sense. For apparently historical reasons, the common approach is either to use simple proportions (which does not address heteroscedasticity) or to use rarefying of counts, even though both of these approaches are inappropriate for detection of differentially abundant species. Well-established statistical theory is available that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability using an appropriate mixture model. Moreover, specific implementations for DNA sequencing read count data (based on a Negative Binomial model for instance) are already available in RNA-Seq focused R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. Here we summarize the supporting statistical theory and use simulations and empirical data to demonstrate substantial improvements provided by a relevant mixture model framework over simple proportions or rarefying. We show how both proportions and rarefied counts result in a high rate of false positives in tests for species that are differentially abundant across sample classes. Regarding microbiome sample-wise clustering, we also show that the rarefying procedure often discards samples that can be accurately clustered by alternative methods. We further compare different Negative Binomial methods with a recently-described zero-inflated Gaussian mixture, implemented in a package called metagenomeSeq. We find that metagenomeSeq performs well when there is an adequate number of biological replicates, but it nevertheless tends toward a higher false positive rate. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.},

For this study, Sedge Warbler (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) feathers were used from four different locations within Europe. Prior to analyses, dust particles from the feathers surface were removed with nitrogen gas. The shaft and the vane parts of the feather were analysed separately. Generally, the vane had higher trace element abundances compared to the shaft. The vane contained between 3 ng and 12 ng of Sr and the shaft between 0.5 ng and 3 ng of Sr. Due to the small amount of Sr in the feathers, small loads (0.5–12 ng Sr) of international standard NBS 987 were analysed for 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios giving an average of 0.710263 ± 0.000013 (2) (n = 177) and an external reproducibility below 0.002\%. The average 88Sr beam intensities for all the shaft analyses were 0.79 V while for the vane analyses it was 2.7 V, consistent with the measured Sr contents of the feather shafts and vanes. The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios of the vane were more precise than the shaft with 2 SD internal precision of 0.0026\% and 0.053\%, respectively. However, the precision was adequate for resolving Sr isotope variations between localities. The 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios of the cleaned Sedge Warbler feathers varied geographically and were indicative of the different geology in the locations where the feathers were grown.},

	abstract = {The wings of insects are composed of membranes supported by interconnected veins. Within these veins are epithelial cells, nerves and tracheae, and their maintenance requires the flow of hemolymph. For this purpose, insects employ accessory pulsatile organs (auxiliary hearts) that circulate hemolymph throughout the wings. Here, we used correlative approaches to determine the functional mechanics of hemolymph circulation in the wings of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Examination of sectioned tissues and intravital videos showed that the wing heart is located underneath the scutellum and is separate from the dorsal vessel. It is composed of a single pulsatile diaphragm (indicating that it is unpaired) that contracts at 3 Hz and circulates hemolymph throughout both wings. The wing heart contracts significantly faster than the dorsal vessel, and there is no correlation between the contractions of these two pulsatile organs. The wing heart functions by aspirating hemolymph out of the posterior wing veins, which forces hemolymph into the wings via anterior veins. By tracking the movement of fluorescent microspheres, we show that the flow diameter of the wing circulatory circuit is less than 1 µm, and we present a spatial map detailing the flow of hemolymph across all the wing veins, including the costa, sub-costa, ambient costa, radius, media, cubitus anterior, anal vein and crossveins. We also quantified the movement of hemolymph within the radius and within the ambient costa, and show that hemolymph velocity and maximum acceleration are higher when hemolymph is exiting the wing.},

This review provides a survey of the various living components in insect wings, as well as the specific contribution of the circulatory and tracheal systems to provide all essential substances. In most insects, hemolymph circulates through the veinal network in a loop flow caused by the contraction of accessory pulsatile organs in the thorax. In other insects, hemolymph oscillates into and out of the wings due to the complex interaction of several factors, such as heartbeat reversal, intermittent pumping of the accessory pulsatile organs in the thorax, and the elasticity of the wall of a special type of tracheae. A practically unexplored subject is the need for continuous hydration of the wing cuticle to retain its flexibility and toughness, including the associated problem of water loss due to evaporation. Also, widely neglected is the influence of the hemolymph mass and the circulating flow in the veins on the aerodynamic properties of insect wings during flight. Ventilation of the extraordinarily long wing tracheae is probably accomplished by intricate interactions with the circulatory system, and by the exchange of oxygen via cutaneous respiration.},

Water unaffected by agriculture in western Denmark has an average 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7124 as compared to an average of 0.7097 in water from nearby farmland. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio obtained from samples over 1.5 km along a stream, which originates in a forest and flows through lime-treated farmland, decreased from 0.7131 to 0.7099. Thus, 87Sr/86Sr-based mobility and provenance studies in regions with low to noncalcareous soils should be reassessed.

Here, we review the role of NHCs in advancing our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary responses of insects to recent global changes. Insect NHCs have helped document changes in insects' geographical distributions, phenology, phenotypic and genotypic traits over time periods up to a century. Recent work demonstrates the enormous potential of NHCs data for examining insect responses at multiple temporal, spatial and phylogenetic scales. Moving forward, insect NHCs offer unique opportunities to examine the morphological, chemical and genomic information in each specimen, thus advancing our understanding of the processes underlying species' ecological and evolutionary responses to rapid, widespread global changes.

	abstract = {Studies to date have documented substantial variation among species in the degree to which phenology responds to temperature and shifts over time, but we have a limited understanding of the causes of such variation. Here, we use a spatially and temporally extensive data set (ca. 48 000 observations from across Canada) to evaluate the utility of museum collection records in detecting broad-scale phenology-temperature relationships and to test for systematic differences in the sensitivity of phenology to temperature (days °C À1) of Canadian butterfly species according to relevant ecological traits. We showed that the timing of flight season predictably responded to temperature both across space (variation in average temperature from site to site in Canada) and across time (variation from year to year within each individual site). This reveals that collection records, a vastly underexploited resource, can be applied to the quantification of broad-scale relationships between species' phenology and temperature. The timing of the flight season of earlier fliers and less mobile species was more sensitive to temperature than later fliers and more mobile species, demonstrating that ecological traits can account for some of the interspecific variation in species' phenologi-cal sensitivity to temperature. Finally, we found that phenological sensitivity to temperature differed across time and space implying that both dimensions of temperature will be needed to translate species' phenological sensitivity to temperature into accurate predictions of species' future phenological shifts. Given the widespread temperature sensitivity of flight season timing, we can expect long-term temporal shifts with increased warming [ca. 2.4 days °C À1 (0.18 SE)] for many if not most butterfly species.},

While it was demonstrated that this species massively migrates from Europe to the Afrotropics during the autumn, the existence of a reverse migration from the Afrotropics to Europe in the early spring remains hypothetical. Here, we analysed wing stable hydrogen isotope values (δ2H) of V. cardui migrants collected from February to April across the circum-Mediterranean region. We assessed their region of natal origin by comparing their wing isotope signature predicted δ2H values (isoscape). The results unambiguously demonstrate a sub-Saharan origin for many individuals, especially those collected in February, representing the first tangible evidence for a reverse northwards trans-Saharan migration in spring.

	abstract = {Bataille and Bowen (2012) developed models to predict variations in the ratio of 87-strontium to 86-strontium (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) in rocks (bedrock model) and rivers (catchment water model) for regional provenance studies. Here, we revisit those models' formulation and calibration and apply them to predict Sr concentrations ([Sr]) and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of Alaskan rivers. In a first step, we add several new components and/or improvements to resolve limitations of the model, including: 1) an independent siliciclastic sediment sub-model, 2) an explicit consideration of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variability at the local scale, and 3) a fully-coupled assessment of prediction uncertainty. Tested against a compilation of 885 87 Sr/ 86 Sr rock analyses across Alaska, the new bedrock model significantly improves 87 Sr/ 86 Sr prediction accuracy in both igneous and sedimentary settings. In a second step, we develop a fully independent Sr chemical weathering model calibrated using a database of 339 [Sr] analyses from rivers of Northern Hemisphere high-latitude and predicting spatial variations in the rate of Sr release from rocks as a function of lithology, permafrost cover and slope. We combine the bedrock and Sr chemical weathering models to predict [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in Alaskan rivers. Tested on a dataset of 61 water samples, the resulting catchment water model explains 82\% of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr variations in Alaskan rivers. We compare the average [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of Alaskan runoff estimated with the catchment water model to observed data of the Yukon River. The estimated average [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of Alaskan surface runoff-104.3 μg/L and 0.7098 respectively-differ significantly from those of the Yukon River-139.3 μg/L and 0.7137 respectively. This result calls into question the assumption that [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values estimated only from large rivers are representative of the Sr weathering flux from the entire Earth surface. The data products from this work provide an alternative basis for estimating 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in rocks and rivers for regional provenance and chemical weathering studies across Alaska.},

	issn = {15314332},
	doi = {10.1016/j.cbpa.2015.10.020},
	abstract = {Over the last decade, numerous studies have investigated the role of oxygen in setting thermal tolerance in aquatic animals, and there has been particular focus on arthropods. Arthropods comprise one of the most species-rich taxonomic groups on Earth, and display great diversity in the modes of ventilation, circulation, blood oxygen transport, with representatives living both in water (mainly crustaceans) and on land (mainly insects). The oxygen and capacity limitation of thermal tolerance (OCLTT) hypothesis proposes that the temperature dependent performance curve of animals is shaped by the capacity for oxygen delivery in relation to oxygen demand. If correct, oxygen limitation could provide a mechanistic framework to understand and predict both current and future impacts of rapidly changing climate. In arthropods, most studies testing the OCLTT hypothesis have considered tolerance to thermal extremes. These studies likely operate from the philosophical viewpoint that if the model can predict these critical thermal limits, then it is more likely to also explain loss of performance at less extreme, non-lethal temperatures, for which much less data is available. Nevertheless, the extent to which lethal temperatures are influenced by limitations in oxygen supply remains unresolved. Here we critically evaluate the support and universal applicability for oxygen limitation being involved in lethal temperatures in crustaceans and insects. The relatively few studies investigating the OCLTT hypothesis at low temperature do not support a universal role for oxygen in setting the lower thermal limits in arthropods. With respect to upper thermal limits, the evidence supporting OCLTT is stronger for species relying on underwater gas exchange, while the support for OCLTT in air-breathers is weak. Overall, strongest support was found for increased anaerobic metabolism close to thermal maxima. In contrast, there was only mixed support for the prediction that aerobic scope decreases near critical temperatures, a key feature of the OCLTT hypothesis. In air-breathers, only severe hypoxia ({\textless} 2 kPa) affected heat tolerance. The discrepancies for heat tolerance between aquatic and terrestrial organisms can to some extent be reconciled by differences in the capacity to increase oxygen transport. As air-breathing arthropods are unlikely to become oxygen limited under normoxia (especially at rest), the oxygen limitation component in OCLTT does not seem to provide sufficient information to explain lethal temperatures. Nevertheless, many animals may simultaneously face hypoxia and thermal extremes and the combination of these potential stressors is particularly relevant for aquatic organisms where hypoxia (and hyperoxia) is more prevalent. In conclusion, whether taxa show oxygen limitation at thermal extremes may be contingent on their capacity to regulate oxygen uptake, which in turn is linked to their respiratory medium (air vs. water). Fruitful directions for future research include testing multiple predictions of OCLTT in the same species. Additionally, we call for greater research efforts towards studying the role of oxygen in thermal limitation of animal performance at less extreme, sub-lethal temperatures, necessitating studies over longer timescales and evaluating whether oxygen becomes limiting for animals to meet energetic demands associated with feeding, digestion and locomotion.},

	abstract = {Recent reviews of the adaptive hypotheses for animal responses to acclimation have highlighted the importance of distinguishing between developmental and adult (non-developmental) phenotypic plasticity. There has been little work, however, on separating the effects of developmental plasticity from adult acclimation on physiological traits. Therefore, we investigated the relative contributions of these two distinct forms of plasticity to the environmental physiology of adult tsetse flies by exposing developing pupae or adult flies to different temperatures and comparing their responses. We also exposed flies to different temperatures during development and re-exposed them as adults to the same temperatures, to investigate possible cumulative effects. Critical thermal maxima were relatively inflexible in response to acclimation temperatures (21, 25, 29 degrees C) with plasticity type accounting for the majority of the variation (49-67\%, nested ANOVA). By contrast, acclimation had a larger effect on critical thermal minima with treatment temperature accounting for most of the variance (84-92\%). Surprisingly little of the variance in desiccation rate could be explained by plasticity type (30-47\%). The only significant effect of acclimation temperature on standard (resting) metabolic rate of adult flies was at 21 degrees C, resulting in treatment temperature, rather than plasticity type, accounting for the majority of the variance (30-76\%). This study demonstrates that the stage at which acclimation takes place has significant, though often different, effects on several adult physiological traits in G. pallidipes, and therefore that it is not only important to consider the form of plasticity but also the direction of the response and its significance from a life-history perspective.},

The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui undertakes a long-distance annual migration between Europe and Africa. While spring flights from the Maghreb to Europe are well characterized, it is not known how far the European autumn migrants travel into Africa and whether they massively cross the Sahara Desert. We conducted fieldwork in four African countries (Chad, Benin, Senegal, and Ethiopia) in autumn and documented southward migrants in central Chad and abundant breeding sites across the tropical savannah as far south as the Niger River in the west and the Ethiopian highlands in the east. Given directionality and timing, these migrants probably originated in Europe and crossed the Mediterranean, the Sahara and the Sahel, a hypothesis that implies the longest ({\textgreater}4000 km) migratory flight recorded for a butterfly in a single generation. In the light of the new evidence, we revise the prevailing spatiotemporal model for the annual migration of V. cardui to incorporate tropical Africa, which could potentially be regarded as the missing geographic link between autumn (southwards) and spring (northwards) movements.},

	abstract = {Physiological diversification reflects adaptation for specific environmental challenges. As the major physiological process that provides plants with carbon and energy, photosynthesis is under strong evolutionary selection that gives rise to variability in nearly all parts of the photosynthetic apparatus. Here, we discuss how plants, notably those using C4 photosynthesis, diversified in response to environmental challenges imposed by declining atmospheric CO2 content in recent geological time. This reduction in atmospheric CO2 increases the rate of photorespiration and reduces photosynthetic efficiency. While plants have evolved numerous mechanisms to compensate for low CO2, the most effective are the carbon concentration mechanisms of C4, C2, and CAM photosynthesis; and the pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon, mainly by algae. C4 photosynthesis enables plants to dominate warm, dry and often salinized habitats, and to colonize areas that are too stressful for most plant groups. Because C4 lineages generally lack arborescence, they cannot form forests. Hence, where they predominate, C4 plants create a different landscape than would occur if C3 plants were to predominate. These landscapes (mostly grasslands and savannahs) present unique selection environments that promoted the diversification of animal guilds able to graze upon the C4 vegetation. Thus, the rise of C4 photosynthesis has made a significant contribution to the origin of numerous biomes in the modern biosphere.},

	abstract = {The global distribution of C 3  and C 4  plants is required for accurately simulating exchanges of CO 2 , water, and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. It is also important to know the C 3 /C 4  distribution for simulations of the carbon isotope composition of atmospheric CO 2  owing to the distinct fractionations displayed by each photosynthetic type. Large areas of the land surface are spatial and temporal mosaics of both photosynthetic types. We developed an approach for capturing this heterogeneity by combining remote sensing products, physiological modeling, a spatial distribution of global crop fractions, and national harvest area data for major crop types. Our C 3 /C 4  distribution predicts the global coverage of C 4  vegetation to be 18.8 million km 2 , while C 3  vegetation covers 87.4 million km 2 . We incorporated our distribution into the SiB2 model and simulated carbon fluxes for each photosynthetic type. The gross primary production (GPP) of C 4  plants is 35.3 Pg C yr -1 , or ∼ 23\% of total GPP, while that of C 3  plants is 114.7 Pg C yr -1 . The assimilation-weighted terrestrial discrimination against  13 CO 2  is - 16.5‰. If the terrestrial component of the carbon sink is proportional to GPP, this implies a net uptake of 2.4 Pg C yr -1  on land and 1.4 Pg C yr -1  in the ocean using a  13 C budgeting approach and average carbon cycle parameter values for the 1990s. We also simulated the biomass of each photosynthetic type using the CASA model. The simulated biomass values of C 3  and C 4  vegetation are 389.3 and 18.6 Pg C, respectively.},

	abstract = {Spatial patterns of soil δ15N reflect variation in rates of N-cycling processes across landscapes. However, the manner in which soil δ15N is affected by vegetation and topoedaphic properties under nonsteady state conditions is understood poorly. Here we propose and evaluate a conceptual model that explains how soil δ15N values will respond to changes in disturbance regimes (intensification of grazing and removal of fire) and the resultant invasion of a subtropical grassland by woody vegetation dominated by Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite), a N-fixing tree legume. Spatially-specific sampling along a catena (hill-slope) gradient where woody plants are known to have displaced grasses over the past 100 years revealed a positive relationship between soil δ15N and δ13C, and a negative relationship between NDVI and soil δ15N on upland portions of the landscape, indicating that plant cover is a critical determinant of δ15N spatial patterns. Because the dominant woody invader is a N-fixer, its invasion has increased N input and reduced soil δ15N. However, while honey mesquite also invaded and came to dominate lowland portions of the landscape, soil δ15N values in woodlands of intermittent drainages were significantly elevated relative to those in uplands. This is likely attributable to higher soil moisture, clay content, and total N in the lower portions of the catena gradient, which create conditions favoring more rapid Ntransformation rates, higher preferential14N losses (e.g., gaseous), and thus enrichment of 15N. Thus, while spatial and temporal variation of soil δ15N has the potential to be an indicator of disturbance-induced changes in the net N balance, its sensitivity is compromised in topoedaphic settings with where rates of Ntransformation are high. Continued improvements in our understanding of controls over the spatial variability of soil δ15N at the landscape-scale will enhance our ability to use δ15N as a diagnostic tool for inferring N dynamics under both steady-state and disturbed conditions. © 2013 Bai et al.},

	abstract = {The nitrogen (N) cycle involves a set of N compounds transformed by plants and microbes. Some of these N compounds, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) or nitrate (NO3−), are environmental pollutants jeopardizing biodiversity, human health or the global climate. The natural abundances of the common (14N) and rare (15N) stable N isotopes in a given compound, i.e. the isotopic composition, depend on individual production and consumption processes. As each process has an individual preference for the common or rare isotope (isotope effect) the measurement of the isotopic composition has been identified as a powerful tool for improved process understanding and source process identification. Both are key requirements for the development of strategies aiming at mitigating the release of environmental harmful N compounds. However, up to now, no comprehensive compilation of N cycle isotope effects is available. A compilation of isotope effects is also in high demand for testing biogeochemical models as such models are increasingly used to study N cycling in ecosystems and across landscapes and regions. Biogeochemical models are usually calibrated and validated only with single, easily accessible quantities. The isotopic composition of N compounds has a high potential to be used as additional, integrative parameter for a more thorough assessment of simulation results. For instance, the isotopic composition of soil N is determined by fractionation of the most relevant processes and, thus, integrates several N cycle processes, some of which cannot be accessed easily by direct measurement. To implement isotopic fractionation in ecosystem models and to utilize those for model validation, the magnitude of the isotope effects associated with individual transformations in the N cycle need to be assessed. This review summarizes the available methods to determine N isotope effects of various key ecosystem processes, thereby systematically comparing isotope effects for different experimental conditions and processes, exploring the accuracy of theoretical calculations of isotope effects and finally, addressing concepts to implement isotope effects into biogeochemical modeling. Our review shows that published isotope effects for N processes in soil incubations seem to be stronger as compared to those in water saturated systems. In addition to the choice of isotope effects adequate for the respective ecosystem, the challenge for modeling approaches is the sequential calculation of isotopic compositions. Associated numerical inaccuracies can be minimized by controlling the share of reacted substrates, i.e. the time step. The criterion to determine the time step needs to consider the strongest isotope effect, required accuracy of the calculations and the share of substrate consumed from or provided to the compound pool. The combination of biogeochemical models with δ15N methods and novel measures like site preference (SP) of N2O is a promising approach for improving process understanding at various spatial and temporal scales. Nevertheless, the compilation of isotope effects in this review may not only be of benefit for modelers, but also for experimentalists, as measurement and modeling of isotope effects may eventually help to test and validate our current process understanding of the N cycle.},

Measurements of the water vapor mixing ratio paired with stable isotope ratios provide unique information on transport processes and moisture sources that is not available with mixing ratio data alone. Measurements of the D/H isotope ratio of water vapor from Mauna Loa Observatory over 4 weeks in October-November 2008 were used to identify components of the regional hydrological cycle. A mixing model exploits the isotope information to identify water fluxes from time series data. Mixing is associated with exchange between marine boundary layer air and tropospheric air on diurnal time scales and between different tropospheric air masses with characteristics that evolve on the synoptic time scale. Diurnal variations are associated with upslope flow and the transition from nighttime air above the marine trade inversion to marine boundary layer air during daytime. During easterly trade wind conditions, growth and decay of the boundary layer are largely conservative in a regional context but contribute ∼12\% of the nighttime water vapor at Mauna Loa. Tropospheric moisture is associated with convective outflow and exchange with drier air originating from higher latitude or higher altitude. During the passage of a moist filament, boundary layer exchange is enhanced. Isotopic data reflect the combination of processes that control the water balance, which highlights the utility for baseline measurements of water vapor isotopologues in monitoring the response of the hydrological cycle to climate change.

	abstract = {Atmospheric moisture cycling is an important aspect of the Earth's climate system, yet the processes determining atmospheric humidity are poorly understood. For example, direct evaporation of rain contributes significantly to the heat and moisture budgets of clouds, but few observations of these processes are available. Similarly, the relative contributions to atmospheric moisture over land from local evaporation and humidity from oceanic sources are uncertain. Lighter isotopes of water vapour preferentially evaporate whereas heavier isotopes preferentially condense and the isotopic composition of ocean water is known. Here we use this information combined with global measurements of the isotopic composition of tropospheric water vapour from the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) aboard the Aura spacecraft, to investigate aspects of the atmospheric hydrological cycle that are not well constrained by observations of precipitation or atmospheric vapour content. Our measurements of the isotopic composition of water vapour near tropical clouds suggest that rainfall evaporation contributes significantly to lower troposphere humidity, with typically 20\% and up to 50\% of rainfall evaporating near convective clouds. Over the tropical continents the isotopic signature of tropospheric water vapour differs significantly from that of precipitation, suggesting that convection of vapour from both oceanic sources and evapotranspiration are the dominant moisture sources. Our measurements allow an assessment of the intensity of the present hydrological cycle and will help identify any future changes as they occur. ©2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {© 2015 American Ornithologists' Union. The use of stable isotopes in animal ecology depends on accurate descriptions of isotope dynamics within individuals. The prevailing assumption that laboratory-derived isotopic parameters apply to free-living animals is largely untested. We used stable carbon isotopes (δ 13 C) in whole blood from migratory Dunlin (Calidris alpina arcticola) to estimate an in situ turnover rate and individual diet-switch dates. Our in situ results indicated that turnover rates were higher in freeliving birds, in comparison to the results of an experimental study on captive Dunlin and estimates derived from a theoretical allometric model. Diet-switch dates from all 3 methods were then used to estimate arrival dates to the Arctic; arrival dates calculated with the in situ turnover rate were later than those with the other turnover-rate estimates, substantially so in some cases. These later arrival dates matched dates when local snow conditions would have allowed Dunlin to settle, and agreed with anticipated arrival dates of Dunlin tracked with light-level geolocators. Our study presents a novel method for accurately estimating arrival dates for individuals of migratory species in which return dates are difficult to document. This may be particularly appropriate for species in which extrinsic tracking devices cannot easily be employed because of cost, body size, or behavioral constraints, and in habitats that do not allow individuals to be detected easily upon first arrival. Thus, this isotopic method offers an exciting alternative approach to better understand how species may be altering their arrival dates in response to changing climatic conditions.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0004735},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isotopes can provide unique solutions to fundamental problems related to the ecology and evolution of migration and dispersal because prior movements of individuals can theoretically be tracked from tissues collected from a single capture. However, there is still remarkably little information available about how and why isotopes vary in wild animal tissues, especially over large spatial scales. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we describe variation in both stable-hydrogen (deltaD(F)) and strontium ((87)Sr/(86)Sr(F)) isotopic compositions in the feathers of a migratory songbird, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), across 18 sampling sites in North America and then examine potential mechanisms driving this variation. We found that deltaD(F) was correlated with latitude of the sampling site, whereas (87)Sr/(86)Sr(F) was correlated with longitude. deltaD(F) was related to deltaD of meteoric waters where molting occurred and (87)Sr/(86)Sr(F) was influenced primarily by the geology in the area where feathers were grown. Using simulation models, we then assessed the utility of combining both markers to estimate the origin of individuals. Using 13 geographic regions, we found that the number of individuals correctly assigned to their site of origin increased from less than 40\% using either deltaD or (87)Sr/(86)Sr alone to 74\% using both isotopes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that these isotopes have the potential to provide predictable and complementary markers for estimating long-distance animal movements. Combining isotopes influenced by different global-scale processes may allow researchers to link the population dynamics of animals across large geographic ranges.},

The maximum 15N enrichment between litter and deeper soil layers varied strongly with mycorrhizal fungal association, averaging 9.6 ± 0.4\%o in ectomycorrhizal systems and 4.6 ± 0.5\%o in arbuscular mycorrhizal systems. The 15N enrichment varied little with mean annual temperature, precipitation, or nitrification rates. One main factor controlling l5N in soil profiles, fraction- ation against 15N during N transfer by mycorrhizal fungi to host plants, leads to 15N-depleted plant litter at the soil surface and 15N-enriched nitrogen of fungal origin at depth. The preferential preservation of 15N-enriched compounds during decomposition and stabilization is a second important factor. A third mechanism, N loss during nitrification and denitrifi- cation, may account for large 15N enrichments with depth in less N-limited forests and may account for soil profiles where maximum {\textless}515N is at intermediate depths. Mixing among soil horizons should also decrease differences among soil horizons. We sug- gest that dynamic models of isotope distributions within soil profiles that can incorporate multiple processes could provide additional information about the history of nitrogen movements and transforma- tions at a site.},

Here, we review the current state of knowledge of stable isotope enrichment of leaf water, and its relevance for isotopic signals incorporated into plant organic matter and atmospheric gases. Models describing evaporative enrichment of leaf water have become increasingly complex over time, reflecting enhanced spatial and temporal resolution. We recommend that practitioners choose a model with a level of complexity suited to their application, and provide guidance. At the same time, there exists some lingering uncertainty about the biophysical processes relevant to patterns of isotopic enrichment in leaf water. An important goal for future research is to link observed variations in isotopic composition to specific anatomical and physiological features of leaves that reflect differences in hydraulic design. New measurement techniques are developing rapidly, enabling determinations of both transpired and leaf water δ18O and δ2H to be made more easily and at higher temporal resolution than previously possible.

	abstract = {A mechanistic model is presented to quantify both the physical and biochemical fractionation events associated with hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in tree-ring cellulose. The model predicts the isotope ratios of tree-rings, incorporating both humidity and source water environmental information. Components of the model include (1) hydrogen and oxygen isotope effects associated with leaf water enrichment; (2) incorporation of leaf water isotope ratio values into photosynthetic carbohydrates along with the biochemical fractionation associated with autotrophic synthesis; (3) transport of exported carbohydrates (such as sucrose) from leaves to developing xylem in shoots and stems where cellulose is formed; (4) a partial exchange of oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in carbohydrates with xylem sap water during conversion into cellulose; and (5) a biochemical fractionation associated with cellulose synthesis. A modified version of the Craig-Gordon model for evaporative enrichment adequately described leaf water δD and δ18O values. The leaf water model was robust over a wide range of leaf waters for both controlled experiments and field studies, far exceeding the range of values to be expected under natural conditions. The isotopic composition of cellulose was modeled using heterotrophic and autotrophic fractionation factors from the literature as well as the experimentally derived proportions of H and O that undergo exchange with xylem water during cellulose synthesis in xylem cells of tree-rings. The fraction of H and O from carbohydrates that exchange with xylem sap water was estimated to be 0.36 and 0.42, respectively. The proportions based on controlled, long-term greenhouse experiments and field studies where the variations in the δD and δ18O of tree-ring cellulose were measured under different source water isotopic compositions. The model prediction that tree-ring cellulose contains information on environmental water source and atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (related to relative humidity) was tested under both field and greenhouse conditions. This model was compared to existing models to explain cellulose isotope ratios under a wide range of source water and humidity conditions. Predictions from our model were consistent with observations, whereas other models showed large discrepancies as soon as the isotope ratios of source water and atmospheric water deviated from each other. Our model resolves the apparently conflicting and disparate interpretations of several previous cellulose stable isotope ratio studies. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

A decade ago, pioneering studies made use of new analytical methods and demonstrated that the hydrogen-isotopic composition of individual lipids from aquatic and terrestrial organisms can be related to the composition of their growth (i.e., environmental) water. Subsequently, compound-specific deuteriumhydrogen (DH) ratios of sedimentary biomarkers have been increasingly used as paleohydrological proxies over a range of geological timescales. Isotopic fractionation observed between hydrogen in environmental water and hydrogen in lipids, however, is sensitive to biochemical, physiological, and environmental influences on the composition of hydrogen available for biosynthesis in cells. Here we review the factors and processes that are known to influence the hydrogen-isotopic compositions of lipid-sespecially n-alkanes-from photosynthesizing organisms, and we provide a framework for interpreting their DH ratios from ancient sediments and identify future research opportunities. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

	abstract = {Oxygen isotope analysis of archaeological skeletal remains is an increasingly popular tool to study past human migrations. It is based on the assumption that human body chemistry preserves the δ18O of precipitation in such a way as to be a useful technique for identifying migrants and, potentially, their homelands. In this study, the first such global survey, we draw on published human tooth enamel and bone bioapatite data to explore the validity of using oxygen isotope analyses to identify migrants in the archaeological record. We use human δ18O results to show that there are large variations in human oxygen isotope values within a population sample. This may relate to physiological factors influencing the preservation of the primary isotope signal, or due to human activities (such as brewing, boiling, stewing, differential access to water sources and so on) causing variation in ingested water and food isotope values. We compare the number of outliers identified using various statistical methods. We determine that the most appropriate method for identifying migrants is dependent on the data but is likely to be the IQR or median absolute deviation from the median under most archaeological circumstances. Finally, through a spatial assessment of the dataset, we show that the degree of overlap in human isotope values from different locations across Europe is such that identifying individuals' homelands on the basis of oxygen isotope analysis alone is not possible for the regions analysed to date. Oxygen isotope analysis is a valid method for identifying first-generation migrants from an archaeological site when used appropriately, however it is difficult to identify migrants using statistical methods for a sample size of less than c. 25 individuals. In the absence of local previous analyses, each sample should be treated as an individual dataset and statistical techniques can be used to identify migrants, but in most cases pinpointing a specific homeland should not be attempted.},

Accurate information regarding the status and trends of stream resources is vital for their effective conser-vation and management. Most statistical techniques applied to data measured on stream networks were developed for terrestrial applications and are not optimized for streams. A new class of spatial statistical model, based on valid covariance structures for stream networks, can be used with many common types of stream data (e.g., water quality attributes, habitat conditions, biological surveys) through application of appropriate distributions (e.g., Gaussian, binomial, Poisson). The spatial statistical network models account for spatial autocorrelation (i.e., nonin-dependence) among measurements, which allows their application to databases with clustered measurement locations. Large amounts of stream data exist in many areas where spatial statistical analyses could be used to develop novel insights, improve predictions at unsampled sites, and aid in the design of efficient monitor-ing strategies at relatively low cost. We review the topic of spatial autocorrelation and its effects on statistical inference, demonstrate the use of spatial statistics with stream datasets relevant to common research and management questions, and discuss additional applications and development potential for spatial statistics on stream networks. Free software for implementing the spatial statistical network models has been developed that enables custom applications with many stream databases.},

	abstract = {Assessment of isotopic compositions at the base of food webs is a prerequisite for using stable isotope analysis to assess foraging locations and trophic positions of marine organisms. Our study represents a unique application of stable-isotope analyses across multiple trophic levels (primary producer, primary consumer and tertiary consumer) and over a large spatial scale in two pelagic marine ecosystems. We found that δ15N values of particulate organic matter (POM), barnacles and phenylalanine from the muscle tissue of yellowfin tuna all showed similar spatial patterns. This consistency suggests that isotopic analysis of any of these can provide a reasonable proxy for isotopic variability at the base of the food web. Secondly, variations in the δ15N values of yellowfin tuna bulk-muscle tissues paralleled the spatial trends observed in all of these isotopic baseline proxies. Variation in isotopic composition at the base of the food web, rather than differences in tuna diet, explained the 11‰ variability observed in the bulk-tissue δ15N values of yellowfin tuna. Evaluating the trophic position of yellowfin tuna using amino-acid isotopic compositions across the western Indian and equatorial Pacific Oceans strongly suggests these tuna occupy similar trophic positions, albeit absolute trophic positions estimated by this method were lower than expected. This study reinforces the importance of considering isotopic baseline variability for diet studies, and provides new insights into methods that can be applied to generate nitrogen isoscapes for worldwide comparisons of top predators in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Effective conservation strategies for highly migratory species must incorporate information about long-distance movements and locations of high-use foraging areas. However, the inherent challenges of directly monitoring these factors call for creative research approaches and innovative application of existing tools. Highly migratory marine species, such as marine turtles, regularly travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers between breeding and feeding areas, but identification of migratory routes and habitat use patterns remains elusive. Here we use satellite telemetry in combination with compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids to confirm that insights from bulk tissue stable isotope analysis can reveal divergent migratory strategies and within-population segregation of foraging groups of critically endangered leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) across the Pacific Ocean. Among the 78 turtles studied, we found a distinct dichotomy in δ(15)N values of bulk skin, with distinct "low δ(15)N" and "high δ(15)N" groups. δ(15)N analysis of amino acids confirmed that this disparity resulted from isotopic differences at the base of the food chain and not from differences in trophic position between the two groups. Satellite tracking of 13 individuals indicated that their bulk skin δ(15)N value was linked to the particular foraging region of each turtle. These findings confirm that prevailing marine isoscapes of foraging areas can be reflected in the isotopic compositions of marine turtle body tissues sampled at nesting beaches. We use a Bayesian mixture model to show that between 82 and 100\% of the 78 skin-sampled turtles could be assigned with confidence to either the eastern Pacific or western Pacific, with 33 to 66\% of all turtles foraging in the eastern Pacific. Our forensic approach validates the use of stable isotopes to depict leatherback turtle movements over broad spatial ranges and is timely for establishing wise conservation efforts in light of this species' imminent risk of extinction in the Pacific.},

	abstract = {The isotopic composition of atmospheric moisture is determined foremost by the isotope fractionation that accompanies the evaporation occurring over the oceans. This subsequently is modified by rainout on the one hand, and on the other hand by the recycling of precipitation into the atmosphere as a result of evapo-transpiration from the continents or from droplets beneath the cloud base. The marine part of the atmospheric water cycle is described by the model of Craig and Gordon, showing the d-excess value to reflect the humidity gradient from the saturated vapour over the sea (a function of both temperature and salinity) to the ambient humidity. Average conditions correspond to a value of d = 10\%. However, on the leeside of continents and over the Mediterranean Sea, where the humidity deficit in the dry and cold air is large, higher values of up to d = 30‰ are engendered. Similar results are found when the evaporated vapour from lakes and other open water bodies mixes into the atmosphere. A model enabling the quantitative evaluation of the contribution of the evaporation flux to atmospheric humidity is exemplified by the case of the North American Great Lakes. A regional atmospheric water balance model, based on the isotopic composition of runoff and precipitation is presented for the Amazon basin. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Over the past forty years, stable isotope analysis of bone (and tooth) collagen and hydroxyapatite has become a mainstay of archaeological and paleoanthropological reconstructions of paleodiet and paleoenvironment. Despite this method’s frequent use across anthropological subdisciplines (and beyond), the present work represents the first attempt at gauging the effects of inter-laboratory variability engendered by differences in a) sample preparation, and b) analysis (instrumentation, working standards, and data calibration). Replicate analyses of a 14C-dated ancient human bone by twenty-one archaeological and paleoecological stable isotope laboratories revealed significant inter-laboratory isotopic variation for both collagen and carbonate. For bone collagen, we found a sizeable range of 1.8\% for d13Ccol and 1.9\% for d15Ncol among laboratories, but an interpretatively insignificant average pairwise difference of 0.2\% and 0.4\% for d13Ccol and d15Ncol respectively. For bone hydroxyapatite the observed range increased to a troublingly large 3.5\%for d13Cap and 6.7\%for d18Oap, with average pairwise differences of 0.6\%for d13Cap and a disquieting 2.0\%for d18Oap. In order to assess the effects of preparation versus analysis on isotopic variability among laboratories, a subset of the samples prepared by the participating laboratories were analyzed a second time on the same instrument. Based on this duplicate analysis, it was determined that roughly half of the isotopic variability among laboratories could be attributed to differences in sample preparation, with the other half resulting from differences in analysis (instrumentation, working standards, and data calibration). These findings have serious implications for choices made in the preparation and extraction of target biomolecules, the comparison of results obtained from different laboratories, and the interpretation of small differences in bone collagen and hydroxyapatite isotope values. To address the issues arising from inter-laboratory comparisons, we devise a novel measure we term the Minimum Meaningful Difference (MMD), and demonstrate its application. Cit},

	title = {Taking ownership of your own mentoring: {Lessons} learned from participating in the {Earth} {Science} {Women}'s {Network}},
	abstract = {1 M any academics, regardless of rank, often state that their career advancement was due in part to effective mentoring and the role of mentors in their professional development. Mentoring can take many forms— traditional one-on-one relationships, multiple mentoring, peer men-toring, and collective mentoring, among others. One-on-one mentoring relationships are prevalent in academia (MS and PhD advisors, postdoc advisors, tenure committees, etc.), yet these relationships do not necessarily lead to quality mentoring and can potentially fail the expectations and needs of the individual being mentored (the protégé). While some aspects of mentoring are still best served by formal mentoring relationships (i.e., a PhD committee advising the direction of a student's research), we favor a mentoring paradigm that empowers the protégé to actively expand his or her network and find the support needed—from different individuals, in different contexts, over different time spans—utilizing both informal and formal mentoring approaches to best serve individual needs. Seeking and finding mentoring can be important for both career development and psychosocial development (Ragins and Cotton 1999). Mentors facilitate career development through sponsorship and coaching, and by providing challenging assignments, protection, and exposure (Kram 1985). Similarly, mentors provide psychosocial development through interpersonal aspects of the mentoring relationship, helping protégés increase their sense of competence, self-efficacy, and personal development (Ragins and Cotton 1999). 2 {\textbar} The Mentoring Continuum mentoring include success in promotion (Scandura 1992), higher incomes (Chao, Waltz, and Gardner 1992; Dreher and Ash 1990), increased mobility (Scandura 1992), and greater career satisfaction (Fagenson 1989). The documented successes of one-on-one mentoring have led many institutions to adopt more formal mentoring prog-rams in an effort to reach a wider range of participants. However, these more formalized relationships may not produce the same outcomes as informal mentoring relationships, particularly for women and other minorities. The way most mentoring relationships develop can be unfavorable for these groups. Mutual identification and fulfillment of career needs serves as the basis for developing informal mentoring relationships, and mentors tend to select protégés that are younger versions of themselves, allowing them to contribute to future gener-ations and avoid their own stagnation (Ragins and Cotton 1999). Perceived competence and interpersonal comfort are another important part of mentoring relationships (Allen, Poteet, and Burroughs 1997), which are often long term and adapt to the needs of the individuals (Ragins and Cotton 1999). However, one of the largest recognized barriers to the success and advancement of female students is a feeling of disconnection from others in their fields (Kemelgor and Etzkowitz 2001), due to an absence of female role models (National Research Council 2006). Many Earth Science departments, for example, have only one or two female faculty members (Holmes and O'Connell 2005). Such small numbers, below the critical mass to influence change and improve conditions (Etzkowitz et al. 1994), can create a sense of isolation. A lack of role models or understanding of the difficulties faced can make the workplace that much more challenging for women and minorities, particularly in the early stages of their careers. Additionally, when there is no critical mass, the few minorities in senior positions are not always perceived as viable role models; protégés look for mentors who can help them fit in to the institution, and women or minorities who are " the only ones " in their department do not impress protégés as people who can help them fit in (Chesler and Chesler 2002). Subtle bias also adds to the challenges faced by women and minorities in forming mentoring relationships. Moss-Racusin and colleagues (2012) conducted a study that evaluated the difference in how a candidate was evaluated for a lab technician position simply by changing the name (and thereby the gender) of the applicant. They found that the same applicant, when assigned a female name, was determined less},

We analyzed deltaD, delta13C, and delta15N in feathers from 75 mountain plover (Charadrius montanus) chicks sampled in 2001 and from 119 chicks sampled in 2002. We estimated parameters for continuous-response inverse regression models and for discrete-response Bayesian probability models from data for each year independently. We evaluated model predictions with both the training data and by using the alternate year as an independent test dataset. Our results provide weak support for modeling latitude and isotope values as monotonic functions of one another, especially when data are pooled over known sources of variation such as sample year or location. We were unable to make even qualitative statements, such as north versus south, about the likely origin of birds using both deltaD and delta13C in inverse regression models; results were no better than random assignment. Probability models provided better results and a more natural framework for the problem. Correct assignment rates were highest when considering all three isotopes in the probability framework, but the use of even a single isotope was better than random assignment. The method appears relatively robust to temporal effects and is most sensitive to the isotope discrimination gradients over which samples are taken. We offer that the problem of using isotope tracers to infer geographic origin is best framed as one of assignment, rather than prediction.},

We estimate the rate of change in total butterfly abundance and the population trends for 81 species using 21 years of systematic monitoring in Ohio, USA. Total abundance is declining at 2\% per year, resulting in a cumulative 33\% reduction in butterfly abundance. Three times as many species have negative population trends compared to positive trends. The rate of total decline and the proportion of species in decline mirror those documented in three comparable long-term European monitoring programs. Multiple environmental changes such as climate change, habitat degradation, and agricultural practices may contribute to these declines in Ohio and shift the makeup of the butterfly community by benefiting some species over others. Our analysis of life-history traits associated with population trends shows an impact of climate change, as species with northern distributions and fewer annual generations declined more rapidly. However, even common and invasive species associated with human-dominated landscapes are declining, suggesting widespread environmental causes for these trends. Declines in common species, although they may not be close to extinction, will have an outsized impact on the ecosystem services provided by insects. These results from the most extensive, systematic insect monitoring program in North America demonstrate an ongoing defaunation in butterflies that on an annual scale might be imperceptible, but cumulatively has reduced butterfly numbers by a third over 20 years.},

No such pan-European evaluation currently exists. Coordination of such large scale monitoring would require harmonisation across multiple countries of the types of samples collected and analysed-matrices vary in the ease with which they can be collected and the information they provide. We report the first ever pan-European assessment of which raptor samples are collected across Europe and review their suitability for biomonitoring. Currently, some 182 monitoring programmes across 33 European countries collect a variety of raptor samples, and we discuss the relative merits of each for monitoring current priority and emerging compounds. Of the matrices collected, blood and liver are used most extensively for quantifying trends in recent and longer-term contaminant exposure, respectively. These matrices are potentially the most effective for pan-European biomonitoring but are not so widely and frequently Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (},

The use of an appropriate calculation software allowed us to determine the nature of the strontium ionic species present in solution. In order to understand the mechanism of interaction, the influence of various parameters on the complexation was studied. Thus, the interaction was maximum for a C0 3 2 − concentration close to 10 − 2 mol/l, the lowest ionic strength, the most expanded physical form (lyophilisate) and the lowest degree of acetylation of the polymer. We conclude to the formation of a ternary complex between the ion pair Sr 2 + CO 3 2 − and the amino groups of chitosan. We also showed the presence of interactions between chitosan and carbonate ions which hinder further interactions with strontium ions.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0092384},
	abstract = {Protecting a nation's primary production sector and natural estate is heavily dependent on the ability to determine the risk presented by incursions of exotic insect species. Identifying the geographic origin of such biosecurity breaches can be crucial in determining this risk and directing the appropriate operational responses and eradication campaigns, as well as ascertaining incursion pathways. Reading natural abundance biogeochemical markers using mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for tracing ecological pathways as well as provenance determination of commercial products and items of forensic interest. However, application of these methods to trace insects has been underutilised to date and our understanding in this field is still in a phase of basic development. In addition, biogeochemical markers have never been considered in the atypical situation of a biosecurity incursion, where sample sizes are often small, and of unknown geographic origin and plant host. These constraints effectively confound the interpretation of the one or two isotope geo-location markers systems that are currently used, which are therefore unlikely to achieve the level of provenance resolution required in biosecurity interceptions. Here, a novel approach is taken to evaluate the potential for provenance resolution of insect samples through multiple biogeochemical markers. The international pest, Helicoverpa armigera, has been used as a model species to assess the validity of using naturally occurring d 2 H, 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 207 Pb/ 206 Pb and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb isotope ratios and trace element concentration signatures from single moth specimens for regional assignment to natal origin. None of the biogeochemical markers selected were individually able to separate moths from the different experimental regions (150-3000 km apart). Conversely, using multivariate analysis, the region of origin was correctly identified for approximately 75\% of individual H. armigera samples. The geographic resolution demonstrated with this approach has considerable potential for biosecurity as well as other disciplines including forensics, ecology and pest management.},

However, because of their small size, entire individual insects are generally used as single samples in isotope analyses. The present study aimed to determine the degree of isotope similarity among regions of the adult body and eggs in four species of Plecoptera (Amphinemura sp., Sweltsa sp., Kamimuria tibialis Pictet and Ostrovus sp.). Levels of δ 13 C and δ 15 N differ between the four species, being lowest in Amphinemura sp., and with δ 15 N being highest in Sweltsa sp. Egg masses contain consistently the lowest values of δ 13 C in the four species, with the δ 15 N value of eggs being highest in K. tibialis and Ostrovus sp., and lower in Amphinemura and Sweltsa spp. In Sweltsa sp., the δ 15 N levels of the dermal layers and cuticle are lowest, whereas the δ 13 C values of the dermal layers and cuticle are almost equal to those in other regions of the body, except egg masses. Oviposited individuals of Amphinemura and Sweltsa spp. have lower δ 15 N levels than individuals that have not oviposited. The rates of metabolism and incorporation of dietary metabolites will differ depending on the body regions and species. Differences in egg ecology such as egg developmental period and egg buoyancy among species are considered to impact on the values of δ 13 C and δ 15 N.

The determination of infra- and interindividual isotopic variabilities in a lobster and among individuals of crustacean populations yielded small variances of about ±3 per mil for δD values and ±0.3 per mil for δ18O values. Molting stage and sex of crustaceans showed no systematic effects on isotopic composition.

	abstract = {The relative contributions of bedrock and atmospheric sources to bioavailable strontium (Sr) pools in local soils was studied in Northern Israel and the Golan regions through intensive systematic sampling of modern plants and invertebrates, to produce a map of modern bioavailable strontium isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) for regional reconstructions of human and animal mobility patterns. The study investigates sources of variability in bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, in particular the intra-and inter-site range of variation in plant 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios, the range of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of plants growing on marine sedimentary versus volcanic geologies, the differences between ligneous and non-ligneous plants with varying growth and water utilization strategies, and the relative contribution of atmospheric Sr sources from different soil and vegetation types and climatic zones. Results indicate predictable variation in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios. Inter- and intra-site differences in bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios average of 0.00025, while the range of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios measured regionally in plants and invertebrates is 0.7090 in Pleistocene calcareous sandstone and 0.7074 in mid-Pleistocene volcanic pyroclast. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios measured in plants growing on volcanic bedrock show time dependent increases in atmospheric deposition relative to bedrock weathering. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios measured in plants growing on renzina soils depends on precipitation. The spacing between bedrock 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios and plants is highest in wet conditions and decreases in dry conditions. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios measured in plants growing on terra rossa soils is relatively constant (0.7085) regardless of precipitation. Ligneous plants are typically closer to bedrock 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios than non-ligneous plants. Since the bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios currently measured in the region reflect a mix of both exogenous and endogenous sources, changes in the relative contribution of exogenous sources can cause variation over time. Precipitation, the age of the bedrock and the overall Sr concentration must to be taken into consideration when interpreting geographical variation in strontium isotopes throughout a region. Because these factors can change through time, we recommend that Sr data from time periods older than the Holocene be interpreted with caution. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {1. Quantitative analytical approaches for isotopic niche analysis in the trophic diversity studies are proliferating rapidly; however, the assumptions behind the isotopic niche applications are rarely tested. One of the main assumptions is independence of the niche metrics and physiological status of the animals. The aim of this experimental study was to test the relationship between growth and Layman’s metrics of isotopic niche in consumers eating the same food but in different quantities and growing at different rates. 2. Based on research indicating that individual variability in isotopic fractionation increases under suboptimal conditions, I hypothesized that a group of consumers originating from the same population and exposed to food limitation would have greater estimates of the niche breadth and diversity as a result of higher inter-individual variability in growth rate and stable isotope signatures than in non-limiting feeding conditions. This hypothesis was tested using Baltic mysids Neomysis integer fed isotopically uniform diet under laboratory conditions and analysing individual growth and stable isotope signature in concert. 3. As hypothesized, mysid growth rate was a significant negative predictor of most niche metrics. These effects were related to both increased inter-individual variability and higher trophic fractionation in malnourished animals, whereas in actively growing mysids, lower fractionation was observed together with lower values for niche size, isotopic range and trophic diversity. 4. These findings challenge how we interpret the intrapopulation isotopic variance and evaluate isotopic evidence of individual specialization and call for integrated approaches for isotopic niche and growth assessment.},

It is a sensitive geochemical tracer, applicable to large-scale ecosystem studies as well as to centimeter-scaled examination of cation mobility within a soil profile. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios of natural materials reflect the sources of strontium available during their formation. Isotopically distinct inputs from precipitation, dryfall, soil parent material, and surface or groundwater allow determination of the relative proportions of those materials entering or leaving an ecosystem. The isotopic compositions of labile (soil exchange complex and soil solution) strontium and Sr in vegetation reflect the sources of cations available to plants. Strontium isotopes can be used to track the biogeochemical cycling of nutrient cations such as calcium. The extent of cation contributions from in situ weathering and external additions to soil from dust and rain can also be resolved with this method. In this paper, we review the geochemistry and isotopic systematics of strontium, and discuss the use of this method as a tracer of earth surface processes.},

The utility of these fossils for preserving ocean-water compositions is evaluated through analyses of multiple specimens that grew in contemporaneous sea water at individual stratigraphic horizons in the Mississippian-age Burlington-Keokuk Formation of mid-continent North America. Significant variations in Sr, C, and O isotopic compositions are observed in contemporaneous, non-luminescent shells, indicating that apparently pristine brachiopod shell material has been altered by post-depositional processes of diagenesis. The least-altered compositions at each horizon are used to estimate secular variations of 87Sr/86Sr in Early Mississippian ocean water. The estimated rates of change of ocean-water 87Sr/86Sr are comparable in magnitude to the rapid Sr isotopic changes documented for Cenozoic ocean water, for which high-frequency glacial cycles are inferred as a driving mechanism.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Stable isotope analysis has become an indispensable tool for the identification of the flow of matter in ecological sciences. Stable strontium isotope ratios are used in several different scientific fields as markers for provenance, mobility, and migration. A crucial prerequisite for such studies is a reliable definition of local ranges and an estimation of expected isotopic variability. METHODS: To study the local variability of stable strontium isotope ratios at a specific place, a farrow of ecologically and locally grown pigs was investigated and strontium was extracted from their hard tissues (tooth enamel, bones and bristles) as well as soft tissues (meat, organs and blood) via dry and wet ashing procedures and subsequent column separation. (87) Sr/(86) Sr was then measured via TIMS (Thermal ionization mass spectrometry). RESULTS: Reliable (87) Sr/(86) Sr data was generated from all tissue types. Both intra- and inter-individual variability was high and tissue specific patterns could be identified. High ranges occurred in sample types which were analyzed for animals of different age (pigs as well as piglets): teeth, parietal, mandible, femur, and leg muscle as well as in jaw muscle samples, which were only analyzed in adult pigs. Tooth enamel data showed a tooth-type dependent pattern. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that a time factor played a role for the observed variability, e.g. a shift in food supply. Furthermore we presume that local range estimates from literature only work for tissues which integrate all consumed components over a sufficient amount of time and average fluctuations which can be found in tissues with higher turnover rates.},

Several case studies of vector migration, particularly ones illustrating recent progress have been presented. Emphasis has been given to the interactions between migratory flight behavior and atmospheric processes that control the ascent, horizontal movement, aerial concentration or dispersion, and the eventual landing of the vectors. Attention has also been given to aspects of local post-migratory host-seeking flights that result in the inoculation of the virus into new hosts. Priorities for further research on insect vectors have been suggested, which are needed for the formulation or improvement of disease control strategies. There are new field or laboratory tests for vector infectivity utilizing nucleic acid-based methods that are more sensitive than the traditional methods using serology or transmission tests. Further investigations on vector movement are, therefore, largely dependent on funding and research priorities rather than technical constraints per se. Some of the techniques are undoubtedly expensive or have high running costs, but ultimately, the highest costs are probably those of establishing and retaining a highly skilled multi-disciplinary team for a suitably long period.},

Monarchs use a consistent ecological regimen through the summer, but these conditions contrast strikingly with those used during the winter. Hence, monarchs exhibit niche-following among sequential breeding generations but niche-switching between the breeding and overwintering stages of their annual cycle. We projected their breeding ecological niche onto monthly future climate scenarios, which indicated northward shifts, particularly at the northern extreme of their summer movements, over the next 50 yrs; if both monarchs and their milkweed host plants cannot track these changing climates, monarchs could lose distributional area during critical breeding months.},

	abstract = {Migration is a key life history strategy for many animals and requires a suite of behavioural, morphological and physiological adaptations which together form the ‘migratory syndrome’. Genetic variation has been demonstrated for many traits that make up this syndrome, but the underlying genes involved remain elusive. Recent studies investigating migration-associated genes have focussed on sampling migratory and nonmigratory populations from different geographic locations but have seldom explored phenotypic variation in a migratory trait. Here, we use a novel combination of tethered flight and next-generation sequencing to determine transcriptomic differences associated with flight activity in a globally invasive moth pest, the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera. By developing a state-of-the-art phenotyping platform, we show that field-collected H. armigera display continuous variation in flight performance with individuals capable of flying up to 40 km during a single night. Comparative transcriptomics of flight phenotypes drove a gene expression analysis to reveal a suite of expressed candidate genes which are clearly related to physiological adaptations required for long-distance flight. These include genes important to the mobilization of lipids as flight fuel, the development of flight muscle structure and the regulation of hormones that influence migratory physiology. We conclude that the ability to express this complex set of pathways underlines the remarkable flexibility of facultative insect migrants to respond to deteriorating conditions in the form of migratory flight and, more broadly, the results provide novel insights into the fundamental transcriptional changes required for migration in insects and other taxa.},

Two independent data sets from whole-genome shotgun sequencing were merged and assembled together with newly obtained fosmid- and BAC-end sequences. The remarkably improved new assembly is presented here. The 8.5-fold sequence coverage of an estimated 432 Mb genome was assembled into scaffolds with an N50 size of ∼3.7 Mb; the largest scaffold was 14.5 million base pairs. With help of a high-density SNP linkage map, we anchored 87\% of the scaffold sequences to all 28 chromosomes. A particular feature was the high repetitive sequence content estimated to be 43.6\% and that consisted mainly of transposable elements. We predicted 14,623 gene models based on a GLEAN-based algorithm, a more accurate prediction than the previous gene models for this species. Over three thousand silkworm genes have no homologs in other insect or vertebrate genomes. Some insights into gene evolution and into characteristic biological processes are presented here and in other papers in this issue. The massive silk production correlates with the existence of specific tRNA clusters, and of several sericin genes assembled in a cluster. The silkworm's adaptation to feeding on mulberry leaves, which contain toxic alkaloids, is likely linked to the presence of new-type sucrase genes, apparently acquired from bacteria. The silkworm genome also revealed the cascade of genes involved in the juvenile hormone biosynthesis pathway, and a large number of cuticular protein genes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there are few studies investigating the genomes of non-model insects using these approaches. This review discusses the application of next- generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to the study of genomes of wild organisms. We first introduce currently available NGS-based methods—including restriction site-associated DNA sequencing; multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat genotyping by sequencing; target capture; and amplicon, transcriptome, and whole genome sequencing—as useful tools for studies of non-model insects. We also provide guidelines for first-time users of NGS systems. In addition to the massive amount of information that it provides, a major advantage of NGS data is the scalability to future research projects. Studies using NGS technology can answer questions related to basic entomology by focusing on the unique nature of non-model insects in wild environments in a way that is not possible for model organisms.},

In social animals, whole groups can exhibit between-group differences in their collective traits. We examined whether negative frequency-dependent selection (that is, a rare-type advantage) could help to maintain between-group variation. We engineered neighbourhoods of social spider colonies bearing bold or shy foraging phenotypes and monitored their fecundity in situ. We found that bold colonies enjoyed a rare-type advantage that is lost as the frequency of bold colonies in a neighbourhood increases. The success of shy colonies was not frequency dependent. These dynamics seem to be driven by a foraging advantage of bold colonies that is lost in bold neighbourhoods because prey become scarce, and shy colonies perform better than bold colonies under low-resource conditions. Thus, to understand selection on collective traits, it is insufficient to examine groups in isolation. The phenotypic environment in which groups reside and compete must also be considered.},

	abstract = {North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo a spectacular fall migration. In contrast to summer butterflies, migrants are juvenile hormone (JH) deficient, which leads to reproductive diapause and increased longevity. Migrants also utilize time-compensated sun compass orientation to help them navigate to their overwintering grounds. Here, we describe a brain expressed sequence tag (EST) resource to identify genes involved in migratory behaviors. A brain EST library was constructed from summer and migrating butterflies. Of 9,484 unique sequences, 6068 had positive hits with the non-redundant protein database; the EST database likely represents approximately 52\% of the gene-encoding potential of the monarch genome. The brain transcriptome was cataloged using Gene Ontology and compared to Drosophila. Monarch genes were well represented, including those implicated in behavior. Three genes involved in increased JH activity (allatotropin, juvenile hormone acid methyltransfersase, and takeout) were upregulated in summer butterflies, compared to migrants. The locomotion-relevant turtle gene was marginally upregulated in migrants, while the foraging and single-minded genes were not differentially regulated. Many of the genes important for the monarch circadian clock mechanism (involved in sun compass orientation) were in the EST resource, including the newly identified cryptochrome 2. The EST database also revealed a novel Na+/K+ ATPase allele predicted to be more resistant to the toxic effects of milkweed than that reported previously. Potential genetic markers were identified from 3,486 EST contigs and included 1599 double-hit single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 98 microsatellite polymorphisms. These data provide a template of the brain transcriptome for the monarch butterfly. Our "snap-shot" analysis of the differential regulation of candidate genes between summer and migratory butterflies suggests that unbiased, comprehensive transcriptional profiling will inform the molecular basis of migration. The identified SNPs and microsatellite polymorphisms can be used as genetic markers to address questions of population and subspecies structure.},

Detection of climate drivers is critical to predicting climate change effects, but identification of potential drivers may depend on knowing the underlying mechanisms. For the butterfly Speyeria mormonia, one climate driver, snow melt date, has multiple effects on population growth. Snow melt date in year t has density-dependent indirect effects. Through frost effects, early snow melt decreases floral resources, thence per-capita nectar availability, which determines fecundity in the lab. Snow melt date in year t+1 has density-independent direct effects. These effects explain 84\% of the variation in population growth rate. One climate parameter thus has multiple effects on the dynamics of a species with non-overlapping generations, with one effect not detectable without understanding the underlying mechanism. ? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

	abstract = {Stable sulphur isotope ratios ((34)S/(32)S) in animal tissues have been suggested as a tracer of coastal residency of terrestrial animals, but data are lacking that quantify the inland range of the sulphur coastal signal and the effects of seasonality. Here, we present δ(34)S measurements of sheep wool collected seasonally on eight farms across Ireland and wool samples collected opportunistically along the west and east coasts. We observed large ({\textgreater}10‰) δ(34)S differences across the island and we show that wool δ(34)S values were negatively correlated with distance to the west coast. We propose that this is due to the predominantly (south-)westerly airflow, possibly combined with the influence of anthropogenic sulphur deposited from the east. While essentially all the sulphur contained in west-coast wool is of marine origin, relatively high δ(34)S values were still measured {\textgreater}100km inland, suggesting that marine sulphur can be carried over long distances. Seasonal variations are small at the individual level for sedentary grazing animals. We conclude that sulphur isotopes ratios measured in archival keratinous tissues can be used to describe regional δ(34)S isoscapes primarily defined by distance to coasts and thus provide a tool to detect short-term movements of domestic, feral and wild animals within such isoscapes.

	abstract = {According to theory, edge populations may be the best suited to initiate range expansions and climate-driven range shifts if they are locally adapted to extreme edge conditions, or the worst suited to colonize beyond-range habitat if their offspring are genetically and competitively inferior. We tested these contrasting predictions by comparing fitness of low, mid, and high-elevation (edge) populations of the annual Rhinanthus minor, transplanted throughout and above its elevational distribution under natural and experimentally-warmed conditions. Seed from low-quality edge habitat had inferior emergence across sites, but high-elevation seeds were also locally adapted. High-elevation plants initiated flowering earlier than plants from lower populations, required less heat accumulation to mature seed, and so achieved higher lifetime fitness at high elevations. Fitness was strongly reduced above the range, but adaptive phenology enhanced the relative fitness of high-elevation seeds. Experimental warming improved fitness above the range, confirming climate's importance in limiting R. minor's distribution, but eliminated the advantage of local cold-edge populations. These results provide experimental support for recent models in which cold-adapted edge populations do not always facilitate warming-induced range shifts. The highest fitness above the range was achieved by a 'super edge phenotype' from a neighboring mountain, suggesting key adaptations exist at the regional scale even if absent from local edge populations. Our results demonstrate that assessing the value of edge populations will not be straightforward, but suggest that a regional approach to their conservation, potentially enhancing gene flow among them, might maximize species' ability to respond to global change.},

	abstract = {The timing of major life-history events, such as migration and moult, is set by endogenous circadian and circannual clocks, that have been well characterized at the molecular level. Conversely, the genetic sources of variation in phenology and in other behavioral traits have been sparsely addressed. It has been proposed that inter-individual variability in the timing of seasonal events may arise from allelic polymorphism at phenological candidate genes involved in the signaling cascade of the endogenous clocks. In this study of a long-distance migratory passerine bird, the willow warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, we investigated whether allelic variation at 5 polymorphic loci of 4 candidate genes (Adcyap1, Clock, Creb1, and Npas2), predicted 2 major components of the annual schedule, namely timing of spring migration across the central Mediterranean sea and moult speed, the latter gauged from ptilochronological analyses of tail feathers moulted in the African winter quarters. We identified a novel Clock gene locus (Clock region 3) showing polyQ polymorphism, which was however not significantly associated with any phenotypic trait. Npas2 allele size predicted male (but not female) spring migration date, with males bearing longer alleles migrating significantly earlier than those bearing shorter alleles. Creb1 allele size significantly predicted male (but not female) moult speed, longer alleles being associated with faster moult. All other genotype–phenotype associations were statistically non-significant. These findings provide new evidence for a role of candidate genes in modulating the phenology of different circannual activities in long-distance migratory birds, and for the occurrence of sex-specific candidate gene effects.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that migratory insects dominate aerial bioflows in terms of diversity, abundance, and biomass [1–6], the migration patterns of most species, and the effects of their annual fluxes between high- and low-latitude regions, are poorly known. One important group of long-range migrants that remain understudied is a suite of highly beneficial species of hoverfly in the tribe Syrphini, which we collectively term “migrant hoverflies.” Adults are key pollinators [7–10] and larvae are significant biocontrol agents of aphid crop pests [11], and thus, it is important to quantify the scale of their migrations and the crucial ecosystem services they provide with respect to energy, nutrient, and biomass transport; regulation of crop pests; and pollen transfer. Such assessments cannot be made by sporadic observations of mass arrivals at ground level, because hoverflies largely migrate unnoticed high above ground. We used insect-monitoring radars [12] to show that up to 4 billion hoverflies (80 tons of biomass) travel high above southern Britain each year in seasonally adaptive directions. The long-range migrations redistribute tons of essential nutrients (nitrogen [N] and phosphorus [P]) and transport billions of pollen grains between Britain and Europe, and locally produced populations consume 6 trillion aphids and make billions of flower visits. Migrant hoverfly abundance fluctuated greatly between years, but there was no evidence of a population trend during the 10-year study period. Considering that many beneficial insects are seriously declining [7, 10, 13–19], our results demonstrate that migrant hoverflies are key to maintaining essential ecosystem services. Wotton et al. show that hoverflies have seasonally adaptive migration directions, allowing colonization of high-latitude summer breeding areas before their progeny return in autumn. Hoverflies deliver vital biocontrol and pollination services and are increasingly important, as their numbers are stable while other beneficial insects are declining.},

Predation on migratory insects by high-flying bats provides potential for investigating flows of migratory insects across a landscape. Brazilian free-tailed bats, Tadarida brasiliensis, provide valuable ecosystem services by consuming migratory pests, and research suggests migratory insects are an important resource to bats in autumn. We sequenced insect DNA from bat feces collected during the 2010–2012 autumn migrations of insects over southern Texas, and tested the utility of predator–prey interactions for monitoring migratory insect populations by asking: 1) how extensively do bats consume migratory insects during autumn? (2) does the prey community reflect known drivers of insect migrations, e.g. cold fronts? and (3) are migratory insects increasingly important to bats when local food resources decline in autumn? Bats consumed at least 21 species of migratory insects and 44 species of agricultural pests. Prey community richness increased with cold front passage. Bats consumed migratory moths over the entire autumn season, and the proportion of migratory moths in the bat diet increased over the course of the autumn season in all 3 years. This study confirms extensive consumption of migratory insects by bats, links patterns in prey communities to mechanisms driving insect migration, and documents a novel approach to tracking patterns of migratory insect movement. As an important resource for T. brasiliensis in autumn, migratory insects provide stabilizing effects to the local animal community.},

Individuals migrate into Britain each spring, and offspring of these migrants probably return in autumn to over- wintering areas in North Africa and the Middle East. However, the existence of these return migrations has been questioned. 2. Insects usually migrate during the adults' pre-reproductive period (PRP). The length of this period is therefore an index of migratory potential since individuals with longer PRPs have more time to express their potential for flight and to travel further before becoming sexually mature. 3. Offspring of insects from Morocco, Britain and Germany showed that, under both long and short photoperiods, PRP increased with latitude over the range 34-53-degrees-N. There were significant genotype-environment interactions in the effect of photoperiod on length of PRP. 4. However, PRPs of offspring from insects collected in Sweden were no different under a long photoperiod from those of offspring collected further south, and were significantly shorter under a short photoperiod than those of insects from Morocco. 5. With the exception of Swedish moths, offspring from insects collected at higher latitudes had longer PRPs and, therefore, the potential to travel further during migrations. The ability of some individuals to respond to environmental cues signalling habitat deterioration will further increase their potential to return to over-wintering areas further south.},

When complex traits are involved in local adaptation, phenomena such as phenotypic plasticity further hamper evolutionary biologists to study the complex relationships between phenotype, genotype and environment. In this perspective paper, we suggest that the common garden experiment, specifically designed to deal with phenotypic plasticity, has a clear role to play in the study of local adaptation, even (if not specifically) in the genomic era. After a quick review of some high-throughput genotyping protocols relevant in the context of a common garden, we explore how to improve common garden analyses with dense marker panel data and recent statistical methods. We then show how combining approaches from population genomics and genome-wide association studies with the settings of a common garden can yield to a very efficient, thorough and integrative study of local adaptation. Especially, evidence from genomic (for example, genome scan) and phenotypic origins constitute independent insights into the possibility of local adaptation scenarios, and genome-wide association studies in the context of a common garden experiment allow to decipher the genetic bases of adaptive traits.},

Recent estimates based on a study in Texas suggests that mortality during autumn migration may be of the order of 2 million per year or about 3\% of the population. However, MaxEnt models used in that study are not well suited to quantifying mortality at hotspots where monarchs are concentrated by topography such as canyons when crossing highways. Potentially catastrophic mortality could occur at such sites if timing of migration and weather conditions conspire to force a large proportion of the migrating population across highways at low altitude. We investigated monarch mortality 15 October to 11 November, 2018 at two highway crossings in northeastern Mexico known for their frequent and extensive collisions (La Muralla and Santa Catarina). During a 15-19 day period of migration, we collected dead and injured monarchs along a series of 500 m roadside transects. We estimated a minimum total mortality during fall migration at just these sites of about 196,560 individuals. Monarchs exhibited a diurnal pattern of passage at Santa Catarina of peaks in late morning and late afternoon. Average vehicle speeds exceeded posted 60 km/h limits designed to protect monarchs, ranging from 75.1 to 99.6 km/h at La Muralla and 86.6 to 106.8 km/h at Santa Catarina. We recommend finer-scale documentation of migration pathways and an inventory of significant highway crossing hotspots for monarchs during fall migration in northeast Mexico. Mitigative measures could include better enforced vehicle speeds at least during the short period of migration, deflection structures to raise the height of crossing monarchs and/or manipulation of habitat to lower the potential for monarchs descending to roost near key crossing points.},

	abstract = {Never before have we had the luxury of choosing a continent, picking a large phylogenetic group of animals, and obtaining genomic data for its every species. Here, we sequence all 845 species of butterflies recorded from North America north of Mexico. Our comprehensive approach reveals the pattern of diversification and adaptation occurring in this phylogenetic lineage as it has spread over the continent, which cannot be seen on a sample of selected species. We observe bursts of diversification that generated taxonomic ranks: subfamily, tribe, subtribe, genus, and species. The older burst around 70 Mya resulted in the butterfly subfamilies, with the major evolutionary inventions being unique phenotypic traits shaped by high positive selection and gene duplications. The recent burst around 5 Mya is caused by explosive radiation in diverse butterfly groups associated with diversification in transcription and mRNA regulation, morphogenesis, and mate selection. Rapid radiation correlates with more frequent introgression of speciation-promoting and beneficial genes among radiating species. Radiation and extinction patterns over the last 100 million years suggest the following general model of animal evolution. A population spreads over the land, adapts to various conditions through mutations, and diversifies into several species. Occasional hybridization between these species results in accumulation of beneficial alleles in one, which eventually survives, while others become extinct. Not only butterflies, but also the hominids may have followed this path. Butterflies are among the most beloved animals⁠ , beautiful and harmless, they have attracted human attention since prehistoric times (1). Being one of the best-studied insects phenotypically (2), butterflies remain largely unexplored by genomics. Until recently, genomic studies of butterflies were confined to a couple of model organisms and pests, such as Heliconius, monarch, and cabbage white, with initial studies leading to groundbreaking insights into mimicry, migration, and toxin resistance (3-5). We have been expanding these efforts on butterfly genomics to cover a broader range of species (6-11). With the rapid decrease in the price of DNA sequencing and the constant development of analytical methods, the time is ripe to sequence the genomes of all butterfly species over a continent.},

However, because of their repetitive nature, they are difficult to annotate and discovering the specific roles they may play in a lineage can be a daunting task. Heliconiine butterflies are models for the study of multiple evolutionary processes including phenotype evolution and hybridization. We attempted to determine how TEs may play a role in the diversification of genomes within this clade by performing a detailed examination of TE content and accumulation in 19 species whose genomes were recently sequenced. We found that TE content has diverged substantially and rapidly in the time since several subclades shared a common ancestor with each lineage harboring a unique TE repertoire. Several novel SINE lineages have been established that are restricted to a subset of species. Furthermore, the previously described SINE, Metulj, appears to have gone extinct in two subclades while expanding to significant numbers in others. This diversity in TE content and activity has the potential to impact how heliconiine butterflies continue to evolve and diverge.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, researchers have used measurements of carbon stable isotopes to infer the composition of consumers' diets. However, since consumer's tissues may process carbon isotopes differently, particularly following a diet shift, it is possible to use measurements of carbon isotopes in multiple tissues to determine not only the composition of an individual's diet, but also the temporal dynamics thereof. This study examined how stable isotopes of carbon (13C/12C, expressed as δ13C) changed in different adult tissues of two predacious beetles, Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). In the laboratory, we switched ladybeetles from a C3-based diet (soybean aphids, Aphis glycines) to a C4-based one (corn leaf aphids, Rhopalosiphum maidis). The δ13C of metabolically active tissues such as the body fat and reproductive organs changed rapidly (≤ 5 days) following the diet shift. Tissues expected to be more metabolically inert, such as wings, changed more slowly over the same period. Although these general patterns were largely similar between males and females, females had more rapid changes in δ13C in fat and reproductive tissues. However, females showed a significant depletion in δ13C after 10 days, while males' δ13C continued to increase. Given the results of this experiment, it is now possible to distinguish between ladybeetles eating a mixed diet (beetles with multiple tissues at similar, intermediate, equilibrial δ13C signatures) from those that have shifted diets (beetles with different tissues at distinctly different δ13C values). Thus, this approach can be used broadly to infer not only what constitutes the diet of a consumer, but also the temporal history of dietary intake. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Compound-specific isotopic analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) has emerged in the last decade as a powerful approach for tracing the origins and fate of nitrogen in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This approach is based on the empirical observation that source amino acids (SAAs) (i.e., phenylalanine), frac-tionate 15 N very little ({\textless} 0.5‰) during trophic transfer, whereas trophic AAs (TAAs) (i.e., glutamic acid), are greatly (\$6-8‰) enriched in 15 N during each trophic step. The differential fractionation of these two AA groups can provide a valuable estimate of consumer trophic position that is internally indexed to the baseline d 15 N value of the integrated food web. In this paper, we critically review the analytical methods for determining the nitrogen isotopic composition of AAs by gas chromatography-isotope-ratio mass spectrometry. We also discuss methodological considerations for accurate trophic position assessment of organisms using CSIA-AA. We then discuss the advantages and challenges of the CSIA-AA approach using published case studies across a range of topics, including trophic position assessment in various ecosystems, reconstruction of ancient human diets, reconstruction of animal migration and environmental variability, and assessment of marine organic matter dynamics with new classification of microbial fractionation patterns. It is clear that the CSIA-AA approach can provide unique insight into the sources, cycling, and trophic modification of organic nitrogen as it flows through systems. However, this approach will be greatly improved through continued exploration into how biochemical, physiological, and ecological mechanisms affect isotopic fractionation of individual AAs. We end this review with a perspective on future work that will promote the evolution of the rapidly growing field of CSIA-AA.},

Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele-environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.},

The recent development of cost-effective methods for obtaining high-quality genomescale data makes it possible to identify some of the loci responsible for adaptive differences among populations. Two basic approaches for identifying putatively locally adaptive loci have been developed and are broadly used: one that identifies loci with unusually high genetic differentiation among populations (differentiation outliermethods) and one that searches for correlations between local population allele frequencies and local environments (genetic-environment association methods). Here, we review the promises and challenges of these genome scanmethods, including correcting for the confounding influence of a species’ demographic history, biases caused by missing aspects of the genome, matching scales of environmental data with population structure, and other statistical considerations. In each case, we make suggestions for best practices for maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of genome scans to detect the underlying genetic basis of local adaptation.

It has adapted to a wide variety of environmental conditions across its native range in southern and eastern Asia, which includes high-altitude regions. eastern honey bees inhabiting mountains differ morphologically from neighbouring lowland populations and may also exhibit differences in physiology and behaviour. We compared the genomes of 60 eastern honey bees collected from high and low altitudes in Yunnan and Gansu provinces, China, to infer their evolutionary history and to identify candidate genes that may underlie adaptation to high altitude. Using a combination of F ST -based statistics, long-range haplotype tests and population branch statistics, we identified several regions of the genome that appear to have been under positive selection. These candidate regions were strongly enriched for coding sequences and had high haplotype homozygosity and increased divergence specifically in highland bee populations, suggesting they have been subjected to recent selection in high-altitude habitats. Candidate loci in these genomic regions included genes related to reproduction and feeding behaviour in honey bees. Functional investigation of these candidate loci is necessary to fully understand the mechanisms of adaptation to high-altitude habitats in the eastern honey bee.},

	abstract = {Intensive management of urban lawns is globally widespread, predominantly for aesthetic reasons. However, a growing body of knowledge demonstrates negative ecological and environmental effects of this practice. We present a meta-analysis of North American and European studies from 2004 to 2019, which incorporates three previously unpublished datasets from eastern Canada, to investigate how mowing intensity impacts the ecology of urban lawns. The meta-analysis provides aggregated evidence that invertebrate and plant diversity is lower in urban lawns under increased mowing intensity. This decline is independent of the level of contrast between mowing ‘treatment’ and ‘control’ (e.g. height or frequency of mowing), which differed considerably between studies. Intensive mowing also increases the occurrence of pest species (e.g. herbivorous beetle larvae and allergenic plants), though studies in this group were limited to northern environments. Changes in ecosystem-level variables (soil temperature, soil moisture deficit and carbon deficit) were less evident and suggest changes in abiotic processes may take longer to become apparent. An economic case study of the mowing costs in Trois-Rivières, Canada, suggests that cost savings of 36\% may be possible with a modest reduction of mowing frequency. Synthesis and Applications. Increasing urban biodiversity and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are strong motivators for reducing lawn management intensity. We also suggest that the benefits of reducing pest species while saving lawn management costs may provide additional social and economic incentives for decision makers to review urban greenspace management practices.},

Even though there is intense interest in wing pattern evolution and development, the technical challenge of genetically manipulating butterflies has slowed efforts to functionally characterize color pattern development genes. To identify candidate wing pigmentation genes, we used RNA sequencing to characterize transcription across multiple stages of butterfly wing development, and between different color pattern elements, in the painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui. This allowed us to pinpoint genes specifically associated with red and black pigment patterns. To test the functions of a subset of genes associated with presumptive melanin pigmentation, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing in four different butterfly genera. pale, Ddc, and yellow knockouts displayed reduction of melanin pigmentation, consistent with previous findings in other insects. Interestingly, however, yellow-d, ebony, and black knockouts revealed that these genes have localized effects on tuning the color of red, brown, and ochre pattern elements. These results point to previously undescribed mechanisms for modulating the color of specific wing pattern elements in butterflies, and provide an expanded portrait of the insect melanin pathway.},

To help explain and predict parasite load across a broad range of species, quantitative theory has been developed based on fundamental relationships between organism size, temperature and metabolic rate. Here, we elaborate on an aspect of that 'scaling theory for parasitism', and test a previously unexplored prediction, using new data for total ectoparasite load from 263 wild birds of 42 species. We reveal that, despite the expected substantial variation in parasite load among individual hosts, (i) the theory successfully predicts the distinct increase of ectoparasite load with host body size, indicating the importance of geometric scaling constraints on access to host resources, (ii) ectoparasite load appears ultimately limited by access-not to host space-but to host energy, and (iii) there is a currency-dependent shift in taxonomic dominance of parasite load on larger birds. Hence, these results reveal a seemingly new macroecological pattern, underscore the utility of energy flux as a currency for parasitism and highlight the promise of using scaling theory to provide baseline expectations for parasite load for a diversity of host species.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-2586-5},
	abstract = {Background: Butterfly wing color patterns are an important model system for understanding the evolution and development of morphological diversity and animal pigmentation. Wing color patterns develop from a complex network composed of highly conserved patterning genes and pigmentation pathways. Patterning genes are involved in regulating pigment synthesis however the temporal expression dynamics of these interacting networks is poorly understood. Here, we employ next generation sequencing to examine expression patterns of the gene network underlying wing development in the nymphalid butterfly, Vanessa cardui. Results: We identified 9, 376 differentially expressed transcripts during wing color pattern development, including genes involved in patterning, pigmentation and gene regulation. Differential expression of these genes was highest at the pre-ommochrome stage compared to early pupal and late melanin stages. Overall, an increasing number of genes were down-regulated during the progression of wing development. We observed dynamic expression patterns of a large number of pigment genes from the ommochrome, melanin and also pteridine pathways, including contrasting patterns of expression for paralogs of the yellow gene family. Surprisingly, many patterning genes previously associated with butterfly pattern elements were not significantly up-regulated at any time during pupation, although many other transcription factors were differentially expressed. Several genes involved in Notch signaling were significantly up-regulated during the pre-ommochrome stage including slow border cells, bunched and pebbles; the function of these genes in the development of butterfly wings is currently unknown. Many genes involved in ecdysone signaling were also significantly up-regulated during early pupal and late melanin stages and exhibited opposing patterns of expression relative to the ecdysone receptor. Finally, a comparison across four butterfly transcriptomes revealed 28 transcripts common to all four species that have no known homologs in other metazoans. Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive list of differentially expressed transcripts during wing development, revealing potential candidate genes that may be involved in regulating butterfly wing patterns. Some differentially expressed genes have no known homologs possibly representing genes unique to butterflies. Results from this study also indicate that development of nymphalid wing patterns may arise not only from melanin and ommochrome pigments but also the pteridine pigment pathway.},

While the census sizes appear to be very large in many of these species, our understanding of their population genetics and interpopulation con-nectivity remains elusive. Here, we summarize the utility and limitations of mitochondrial DNA barcodes to assess migratory patterns and genetic connectivity among populations of four well-known species of long-distance, mul-tigenerational insect migrants, the butterflies Danaus plexippus and Vanessa cardui, and the dragonflies Pantala flavescens and Anax junius. We contrast the differences between the two butterfly species, which show low genetic diversity and little or no phylogeographic structuring, with the two dragonfly species which show an intriguing pattern of high genetic diversity and no apparent phylogeographic structure. Although a recent population genetic study of P. flavescens reported high gene flow and reduced (or diminished) COI genetic diversity across widely separated geographic regions, suggesting global panmixia, reanalysis of the data from that study revealed high genetic diversity in agreement with other studies on both P. flavescens and A. junius. The presence of isolated populations of P. flavescens, such as found on Easter Island that appear non-migratory, as well as evidence for significant structure among some migratory populations, suggest that concluding global panmixia in P. flavescens may be premature. We also suggest that cost-effective barcode analyses would be the method of choice for preliminary analyses of large data sets required to assess migratory routes and connectivity among populations on a global scale.

In the laboratory, the pest slug Deroceras reticulatum was unaffected by thiamethoxam, but transmitted the toxin to predaceous beetles (Chlaenius tricolor), impairing or killing {\textgreater}60\%.

It is one of the goals of science to uncover the general principles that produce recurring patterns in nature. Although this has happened in many areas of physics and chemistry, ecology is yet to take this important step. Ecological systems are intrinsically complex, but this does not necessarily mean that everything about them is unpredictable or chaotic. Ecologists, whose grand aim is to understand the interactions that govern the distribution, abundance and diversity of living organisms at different scales, have uncovered several regular patterns, i.e. widely observable statistical tendencies, in the abundance or diversity of organisms in natural ecosystems. Some of these patterns, however, are contingent, i.e. they are only true under particular circumstances; nevertheless, the broad generality of many patterns hints at the existence of universal principles. What about parasite ecology: is it also characterized by recurring patterns and general principles? Evidence for repeatable empirical patterns in parasite ecology is reviewed here, in search of patterns that are consistently detectable across taxa or geographical areas. The coverage ranges from the population level all the way to large-scale patterns of parasite diversity and abundance (or biomass) and patterns in the structure of host-parasite interaction networks. Although general laws seem to apply to these extreme scales of studies, most patterns observed at the intermediate scale, i.e. the parasite community level, appear highly contingent and far from universal. The general laws uncovered to date are proving valuable, as they offer glimpses of the underlying processes shaping parasite ecology and diversity. © 2007 Cambridge University Press.},

	abstract = {Background: Adaptive genomics may help predicting how a species will respond to future environmental changes. Genomic signatures of local adaptation in marine organisms are often driven by environmental selective agents impacting the physiology of organisms. With one of the highest salinity level, the Mediterranean Sea provides an excellent model to investigate adaptive genomic divergence underlying salinity adaptation. In the present study, we combined six genome scan methods to detect potential genomic signal of selection in the striped red mullet (Mullus surmuletus) populations distributed across a wide salinity gradient. We then blasted these outlier sequences on published fish genomic resources in order to identify relevant potential candidate genes for salinity adaptation in this species. Results: Altogether, the six genome scan methods found 173 outliers out of 1153 SNPs. Using a blast approach, we discovered four candidate SNPs belonging to three genes potentially implicated in adaptation of M. surmuletus to salinity. The allele frequency at one of these SNPs significantly increases with salinity independently from the effect of longitude. The gene associated to this SNP, SOCS2, encodes for an inhibitor of cytokine and has previously been shown to be expressed under osmotic pressure in other marine organisms. Additionally, our results showed that genome scan methods not correcting for spatial structure can still be an efficient strategy to detect potential footprints of selection, when the spatial and environmental variation are confounded, and then, correcting for spatial structure in a second step represents a conservative method. Conclusion: The present outcomes bring evidences of potential genomic footprint of selection, which suggest an adaptive response of M. surmuletus to salinity conditions in the Mediterranean Sea. Additional genomic data such as sequencing of a full-genome and transcriptome analyses of gene expression would provide new insights regarding the possibility that some striped red mullet populations are locally adapted to their saline environment.},

The genomic basis of such changes is still largely unexplored. Yet, understanding the genomic response to invasion may help to predict the conditions under which invasiveness can be enhanced or suppressed. Here we characterized the genome response of the spotted wing drosophila Drosophila suzukii during the worldwide invasion of this pest insect species, by conducting a genome-wide association study to identify genes involved in adaptive processes during invasion. Genomic data from 22 population samples were analyzed to detect genetic variants associated with the status (invasive versus native) of the sampled populations based on a newly developed statistic, we called C 2, that contrasts allele frequencies corrected for population structure. This new statistical framework has been implemented in an upgraded version of the program BayPass. We identified a relatively small set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that show a highly significant association with the invasive status of populations. In particular, two genes RhoGEF64C and cpo , the latter contributing to natural variation in several life-history traits (including diapause) in Drosophila melanogaster , contained SNPs significantly associated with the invasive status in the two separate main invasion routes of D. suzukii . Our methodological approaches can be applied to any other invasive species, and more generally to any evolutionary model for species characterized by non-equilibrium demographic conditions for which binary covariables of interest can be defined at the population level.},

The ENM approach permits testing and validation of model predictivity, and yields quantitative, testable predictions regarding likely future climate change effects. Our models predicted monarch presence with a high degree of accuracy, and indicated that precipitation and diurnal temperature range were key environmental factors in making locations suitable for monarchs. When we projected monarch distribution onto future climate scenarios (Hadley Centre climate models), we found that conditions were likely to be inadequate across the entire current winter range, particularly owing to increased cool-weather precipitation that could cause increased mortality. This study applies ENM to understanding the seasonal dynamics of a migratory species under climate change, and uses ENM to identify key limiting environmental parameters in species' responses to climate change.},

Here we report forest cover losses from 2012 to 2018 in the core zones of the MBBR where most monarch overwintering colonies perch. We used aerial ortho-photographs and satellite images complemented with field validation for temporal comparisons. During this period, 163.44 ha of forest cover were affected, 125.44 ha due to climate-related factors (rain and wind), 25.86 ha due to large-scale illegal logging, and 12.14 ha due to small-scale illegal logging. The core zone of the MBBR located in the State of Michoacan showed the highest forest cover loss values with 94.07 ha lost due to climate-related factors, and 38.0 ha lost due to illegal logging. Our study also showed a substantial decrease of {\textasciitilde}98\% in large-scale illegal logging in the core zones of the MBBR compared to previous reported forest losses from 2001 to 2012. Forest cover loss was similar, yet the periods of the two studies differed, one 12 years in length, this one 6 years. The decrease of forest cover during the period studied suggests that factors elsewhere rather than forest cover loss in the monarch butterfly's winter habitat have strongly contributed to the dramatic population declines observed in monarch overwintering colonies since 2010.},

Here, we review current reports on the successes of CRISPR/Cas9 applications in diverse insects and insect cells.

The introduction of this relatively new method presents many problems even for experienced researchers, especially with the lack of procedures to tackle issues concerning the efficiency of mutant generation. Here we present a protocol for efficient genome editing in the non-model insect species Pyrrhocoris apterus. We collected data from several independent trials that targeted several genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and determined that several crucial optimization steps led to a remarkably increased efficiency of mutant production. The main steps are as follows: the timing of embryo injection, the use of the heteroduplex mobility assay as a screening method, in vivo testing of sgRNA efficiency, and G0 germline mosaicism screening. The timing and the method of egg injections used here need to be optimized for other species, but other here-described optimization solutions can be applied immediately for genome editing in other insect species.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1913915116},
	abstract = {Seasonal adaptation to changes in light:dark regimes (i.e., photoperiod) allows organisms living at temperate latitudes to anticipate environmental changes. In nearly all animals studied so far, the circadian system has been implicated in measurement and response to the photoperiod. In insects, genetic evidence further supports the involvement of several clock genes in photoperiodic responses. Yet, the key molecular pathways linking clock genes or the circadian clock to insect photoperiodic responses remain largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivating the clock in the North American monarch butterfly using loss-of-function mutants for the circadian activators CLOCK and BMAL1 and the circadian repressor CRYPTOCHROME 2 abolishes photoperiodic responses in reproductive output. Transcriptomic approaches in the brain of monarchs raised in long and short photoperiods, summer monarchs, and fall migrants revealed a molecular signature of seasonal-specific rhythmic gene expression that included several genes belonging to the vitamin A pathway. We found that the rhythmic expression of these genes was abolished in clockdeficient mutants, suggesting that the vitamin A pathway operates downstream of the circadian clock. Importantly, we showed that a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the pathway's rate-limiting enzyme, ninaB1, abolished photoperiod responsiveness independently of visual function in the compound eye and without affecting circadian rhythms. Together, these results provide genetic evidence that the clock-controlled vitamin A pathway mediates photoperiod responsiveness in an insect. Given previously reported seasonal changes associated with this pathway in the mammalian brain, our findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved function of vitamin A in animal photoperiodism.},

	abstract = {Although the Cas9 protein from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) is the most widely used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) variant in genome engineering experiments, it does have certain limitations. First, the stringent requirement for the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence limits the target DNA that can be manipulated using this method in insects. Second, its complementarity specifications are not very stringent, meaning that it can sometimes cause off-target effects at the target site. A recent study reported that an evolved SpCas9 variant, xCas9(3.7), with preference for various 5′-NG-3′ PAM sequences not only has the broadest PAM compatibility but also has much greater DNA specificity and lower genome-wide off-target activity than SpCas9 in mammalian cells. Here we applied the CRISPR/xCas9 system to target the white gene in Drosophila melanogaster, testing the genome-editing efficiency of xCas9 at different PAM sites. On the GGG PAM site, xCas9 showed less activity than SpCas9. For the non-NGG PAM site TGA, xCas9 could produce DNA cleavage and indel-mediated disruption on the target gene. However, for other non-NGG PAM sites, xCas9 showed no activity. These findings show that the evolved Cas9 variant with broad PAM compatibility is functional in Drosophila to induce heritable gene alterations, increasing the targeting range for the applications of genome editing in insects.},

We evaluated changes in birds’ parental provisioning behaviour in the presence of a novel object. As a behavioural trait, we measured the duration of feeding interruption from the first time that each bird noticed the novel object until they entered the nest box. We found a gender-specific association between DRD4 gene polymorphism and parental behaviour. Males with a CC genotype delayed feeding for a longer period than those with CT and TT genotypes. No significant effect of genotype on provisioning behaviour was observed among females. We conclude that (i) DRD4 gene polymorphism in wild birds can be associated with behaviour related to fearfulness, and (ii) this effect is supposedly gender-specific during the breeding time, potentially explained by sex differences in parental care or hormonal levels.},

	doi = {10.1186/1741-7007-7-14},
	abstract = {Background: In the fall, Eastern North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo a magnificent long-range migration. In contrast to spring and summer butterflies, fall migrants are juvenile hormone deficient, which leads to reproductive arrest and increased longevity. Migrants also use a time-compensated sun compass to help them navigate in the south/southwesterly direction en route for Mexico. Central issues in this area are defining the relationship between juvenile hormone status and oriented flight, critical features that differentiate summer monarchs from fall migrants, and identifying molecular correlates of behavioral state. Results: Here we show that increasing juvenile hormone activity to induce summer-like reproductive development in fall migrants does not alter directional flight behavior or its time-compensated orientation, as monitored in a flight simulator. Reproductive summer butterflies, in contrast, uniformly fail to exhibit directional, oriented flight. To define molecular correlates of behavioral state, we used microarray analysis of 9417 unique cDNA sequences. Gene expression profiles reveal a suite of 40 genes whose differential expression in brain correlates with oriented flight behavior in individual migrants, independent of juvenile hormone activity, thereby molecularly separating fall migrants from summer butterflies. Intriguing genes that are differentially regulated include the clock gene vrille and the locomotion-relevant tyramine beta hydroxylase gene. In addition, several differentially regulated genes (37.5\% of total) are not annotated. We also identified 23 juvenile hormone-dependent genes in brain, which separate reproductive from non-reproductive monarchs; genes involved in longevity, fatty acid metabolism, and innate immunity are upregulated in non-reproductive (juvenile-hormone deficient) migrants. Conclusion: The results link key behavioral traits with gene expression profiles in brain that differentiate migratory from summer butterflies and thus show that seasonal changes in genomic function help define the migratory state. © 2009 Zhu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {Long-distance dispersal (LDD) promotes the colonization of isolated and remote habitats, and thus it has been proposed as a mechanism for explaining the distributions of many species. Birds are key LDD vectors for many sessile organisms such as plants, yet LDD beyond local and regional scales has never been directly observed nor quantified. By sampling birds caught while in migratory flight by GPS-tracked wild falcons, we show that migratory birds transport seeds over hundreds of kilometres and mediate dispersal from main- land to oceanic islands. Up to 1.2\% of birds that reached a small island of the Canary Archipelago (Alegranza) during their migration from Europe to Sub-Saharan Africa carried seeds in their guts. The billions of birds making seasonal migrations each year may then transport millions of seeds. None of the plant species transported by the birds occurs in Alegranza and most do not occur on nearby Canary Islands, providing a direct example of the impor- tance of environmental filters in hampering successful colonization by immigrant species. The constant propagule pressure generated by these LDD events might, nevertheless, explain the colonization of some islands. Hence, migratory birds can mediate rapid range expansion or shifts of many plant taxa and determine their distribution.},

	abstract = {1. Annual energy, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes across the river mouth by Atlantic salmon were estimated for 18 years (1976-94) in the Norwegian River Imsa. The total energy content of the emigrating smolts in each year varied considerably with a mean value of 237 × 103 kJ. That of returning adults also varied between years with a mean value of 141 × 104 kJ. One-sea-winter salmon (grilse) made up 65\% of the total energy content of the spawners in the river. Dead carcasses remaining in the river after spawning were estimated to have a mean annual energy content of 175 × 103 kJ. 2. The net annual energy flux from the sea to the river varied between 48 × 103 kJ (1987) and 152 × 104 kJ (1989) with a mean of 616 × 103 kJ, and a coefficient of variation of 67\%. Average net marine import of the returning adults was 83 × 104 kJ year-1 with a coefficient of variation of 52\%. Mean annual export of C, N and P to sea by the smolts was 595, 131 and 22 kg, and by kelts 1535, 352 and 70 kg, respectively, whereas gross import via the adults was 3176 kg C, 735 kg N and 132 kg P. The annual flux across the river mouth was 1046 kg C, 253 kg N and 39 kg P. The net marine import were 1585 kg C, 371 kg N and 60 kg P. The net flux was estimated at 0.2\% for nitrogen and 5\% for phosphorus of the total river load. 3. The energy flux caused by Atlantic salmon spawning in the River Imsa was relatively high because the general nutrient load in the river is low. Thus, even though most Atlantic salmon survive spawning, their contribution to the nutrient flux in the river is significant.},

Poaching has remained a persistent problem through the 50 year long history of Serengeti National Park. Around 2 million people live along the borders of the park. Poverty is widespread, and the population is increasing rapidly. In this paper we examine the local perceptions of importance and reasons for hunting, gender differences and opinions about mitigating measures among villagers around Serengeti's Western Corridor. The data were collected through interviewing 590 persons in eight villages close to the borders of the park. Hunting is driven by the need to not only increase food supply and cash income, but also fulfil cultural and social needs. We also identified a proactive attitude in the rural communities towards reducing illegal hunting and more constructive relationships with the management authorities of the national park. The role of hunting in community life extends beyond the immediate poverty issue, and should be seen as an element in the larger development agenda of rural Tanzania and the quest for models for sustainable wildlife management. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	abstract = {1. Every year billions of insects engage in long-distance, seasonal mass migrations which have major consequences for agriculture, ecosystem services and insect-vectored diseases. Tracking this movement in the field is difficult, with mass migrations often occurring at high altitudes and over large spatial scales. 2. As such, tethered flight provides a valuable tool for studying the flight behaviour of insects, giving insights into flight propensity (e.g. distance, duration and velocity) and orientation under controlled laboratory settings. By experimentally manipulating a variety of environmental and physiological traits, numerous studies have used this technology to study the flight behaviour of migratory insects ranging in size from aphids to butterflies. Advances in functional genomics promise to extend this to the identification of genetic factors associated with flight. Tethered flight techniques have been used to study migratory flight characteristics in insects for more than 50 years, but have never been reviewed. 3. This study summarises the key findings of this technology, which has been employed in studies of species from six Orders. By providing detailed descriptions of the tethered flight systems, the present study also aims to further the understanding of how tethered flight studies support field observations, the situations under which the technology is useful and how it might be used in future studies. 4. The aim is to contextualise the available tethered flight studies within the broader knowledge of insect migration and to describe the significant contribution these systems have made to the literature.},

	abstract = {Before submarine hydrothermal vents were discovered, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr record of seawater was interpreted as a mixture of unradiogenic basaltic and radiogenic granitic continental runoff, strongly buffered by contributions from carbonate weathering. Since the discovery of submarine hydrothermal vents this record has generally been viewed as a mixture of multiple components of which radiogenic continental runoff and unradiogenic submarine hydrothermal fluids are the most significant. A critical review of sources of Sr to seawater indicates that the Sr budget of the modern ocean requires {\textasciitilde}1.4 × 10 10 mol yr −1 of submarine hydrothermal Sr to balance the present-day 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of freshwater inputs. This flux is about twice what observations of ocean crust alteration and hydrothermal inputs seem to support. The globally averaged, bias-corrected, and Sr flux-weighted 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of rivers and submarine groundwater discharge is 0.7103–0.7108, and thus significantly less radiogenic than the average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of the upper continental crust ({\textgreater}0.72). Global analyses of runoff from large-scale drainage regions as well as 76 individual river basins with large dissolved Sr fluxes to the ocean reveal positive correlations between the dissolved riverine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and the average bedrock age of drainage regions and individual river basins. The current flux of continental Sr to the ocean is biased towards contributions from younger bedrock (331 Myr) compared to the average bedrock age of the exorheic land area (445 Myr). This correlation supports the notion that variations in the marine 87 Sr/ 86 Sr are influenced by variations in the composition and age structure of exorheic continental bedrock. Quantitative evaluation of the average age of exorheic bedrock, weighted according to the dissolved Sr flux, indicates that the temporal variations of this parameter that are required to account for the observed temporal variations in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of seawater depend primarily on the slope of the correlations between dissolved 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and bedrock age. The required variations in average exorheic bedrock age are consistent with changes predicted by the paleogeologic reconstructions of the Phanerozoic and appear to be geologically sensible. The data imply that improvements in our understanding of the driving forces of changes in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and other radiogenic isotope records of seawater critically depend on improved reconstructions of paleogeology, paleogeography and paleohydrology.},

This has been causing rapid environmental shifts that have altered the selective regimes determining the annual organization of birds. In order to assess the potential for adaptive evolution in the timing of autumn migration, we estimated heritabilities of the onset of migratory activity in a southern German blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla) population. Heritabilities (h2=0.34-0.45) and coefficients of additive genetic variation (CVA=4.7-5.7) were significant and consistent when estimated by different methods, irrespective of whether they were derived from birds hatched in the wild or bred in captivity. In an artificial selection experiment, we selected for later onset of migratory activity, simulating expected natural selection on this trait. We obtained a significant delay in the mean onset of migratory activity by more than one week after two generations of selection. Realized heritability (h2=0.55) was in agreement with expected heritability in the cohort that the selection line was derived from. Our results suggest that evolutionary changes in the timing of autumn migration may take place over a very short time period and will most probably be unconstrained by the lack of additive genetic variation.},

While genomic studies have provided new insight into migration-associated and circadian clock genes, the general lack of simple and versatile reverse-genetic methods has limited in vivo functional analysis of candidate genes in this species. Here, we report the establishment of highly efficient and heritable gene mutagenesis methods in the monarch butterfly using transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and CRISPR-associated RNA-guided nuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9). Using two clock gene loci, cryptochrome 2 and clock (clk), as candidates, we show that both TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9 generate high-frequency nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ)-mediated mutations at targeted sites (up to 100\%), and that injecting fewer than 100 eggs is sufficient to recover mutant progeny and generate monarch knockout lines in about 3 months. Our study also genetically defines monarch CLK as an essential component of the transcriptional activation complex of the circadian clock. The methods presented should not only greatly accelerate functional analyses of many aspects of monarch biology, but are also anticipated to facilitate the development of these tools in other nontraditional insect species as well as the development of homology-directed knock-ins.},

In both lowland and alpine complexes, molecular - functional properties of the polymorphic genotypes can be used to predict genotype-specific adult flight performances and resulting large genotypic differences in adult fitness components. In the lowland species complex, there is striking uniformity of PGI polymorph frequencies at a number of sites across the American West; this fits with earlier findings of strong, similar differences in fitness components over this range. In an alpine complex, Colias meadii shows similar uniformity of PGI frequencies within habitat types, either montane steppe or alpine tundra, over several hundred kilometres in the absence of dispersal. At the same time, large shifts (10-20\%) in frequency of the most common alleles occur between steppe and tundra populations, whether these are isolated or, as in some cases, are in contact and exchange many dispersing adults each generation. Data on male mating success of common C. meadii PGI genotypes in steppe and tundra show heterozygote advantage in both habitat types, with shifts in relative homozygote disadvantage between habitats which are consistent with observed frequency differences. Nonadaptive explanations for this situation are rejected, and alternative, thermal-ecology-based adaptive hypotheses are proposed for later experimental test. These findings show that strong local selection may dominate dispersal as an evolutionary agent, whether or not dispersal is present, and that selection may often be the major force promoting 'cohesion' of species over long distances. This case offers new opportunities for integrating studies of molecular structure and function with ecological aspects of natural selection in the wild, both within and among species.},

However, the use of RNAi for functional genomics has not fully extended into ecological model organisms in natural environments. Assessment of gene function in the wild is important because gene function can be environmentally and context dependent. Here, we present a case study using RNAi to assess gene function in wild paper wasps Polistes metricus, to test roles for two candidate genes (NADH dehydrogenase (NADHdh) and retinoid and fatty acid binding protein (RfaBp)) in the development of reproductive castes. Previous studies have shown that these genes are upregulated in larvae that become queens compared to workers, but this pattern was reversed in the laboratory, making field-based studies necessary. We orally administered dsRNA to larvae in field colonies and found evidence of a short-term knockdown followed by a compensatory rebound in expression for RfaBp. We also observed the predicted worker-like decrease in lipid stores in NADHdh dsRNA treated wasps, suggesting a possible role for NADHdh in caste development. We discuss our results in the context of challenges for using RNAi for functional genomics in ecological model organisms in the field.},

	abstract = {Polymorphisms in several neurotransmitter-associated genes have been associated with variation in human personality traits. Among the more promising of such associations is that between the human dopamine receptor D4 gene (Drd4) variants and novelty-seeking behaviour. However, genetic epistasis, genotype-environment interactions and confounding environmental factors all act to obscure genotype-personality relationships. Such problems can be addressed by measuring personality under standardized conditions and by selection experiments, with both approaches only feasible with non-human animals. Looking for similar Drd4 genotype-personality associations in a free-living bird, the great tit (Parus major), we detected 73 polymorphisms (66 SNPs, 7 indels) in the P. major Drd4 orthologue. Two of the P. major Drd4 gene polymorphisms were investigated for evidence of association with novelty-seeking behaviour: a coding region synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP830) and a 15 bp indel (ID15) located 5′ to the putative transcription initiation site. Frequencies of the three Drd4 SNP830 genotypes, but not the ID15 genotypes, differed significantly between two P. major lines selected over four generations for divergent levels of 'early exploratory behaviour' (EEB). Strong corroborating evidence for the significance of this finding comes from the analysis of free-living, unselected birds where we found a significant association between SNP830 genotypes and differing mean EEB levels. These findings suggest that an association between Drd4 gene polymorphisms and animal personality variation predates the divergence of the avian and mammalian lineages. Furthermore, this work heralds the possibility of following microevolutionary changes in frequencies of behaviourally relevant Drd4 polymorphisms within populations where natural selection acts differentially on different personality types. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

D. wrightii is the innately preferred nectar source and oviposition host for M. sexta. Hence, the hawkmoth is an important pollinator while the M. sexta larvae are specialized herbivores of the plant. Olfactory detection of plant volatiles plays a crucial role in the behavior of the hawkmoth. In vivo, the odorant receptor coreceptor (Orco) is an obligatory component for the function of odorant receptors (ORs), a major receptor family involved in insect olfaction. We used CRISPR-Cas9 targeted mutagenesis to knock out (KO) the MsexOrco gene to test the consequences of a loss of OR-mediated olfaction in an insect-plant relationship. Neurophysiological characterization revealed severely reduced antennal and antennal lobe responses to representative odorants emitted by D. wrightii. In a wind-tunnel setting with a flowering plant, Orco KO hawkmoths showed disrupted flight orientation and an ablated proboscis extension response to the natural stimulus. The Orco KO gravid female displayed reduced attraction toward a nonflowering plant. However, more than half of hawkmoths were able to use characteristic odor-directed flight orientation and oviposit on the host plant.

Convergent evolution can be used as a guide to identify candidate mutations that underlie adaptive traits2–4, and new genome editing technology is facilitating functional validation of these mutations in whole organisms1,5. We combined these approaches to study a classic case of convergence in insects from six orders, including the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), that have independently evolved to colonize plants that produce cardiac glycoside toxins6–11. Many of these insects evolved parallel amino acid substitutions in the α-subunit (ATPα) of the sodium pump (Na+/K+-ATPase)7–11, the physiological target of cardiac glycosides12. Here we describe mutational paths involving three repeatedly changing amino acid sites (111, 119 and 122) in ATPα that are associated with cardiac glycoside specialization13,14. We then performed CRISPR–Cas9 base editing on the native Atpα gene in Drosophila melanogaster flies and retraced the mutational path taken across the monarch lineage11,15. We show in vivo, in vitro and in silico that the path conferred resistance and target-site insensitivity to cardiac glycosides16, culminating in triple mutant ‘monarch flies’ that were as insensitive to cardiac glycosides as monarch butterflies. ‘Monarch flies’ retained small amounts of cardiac glycosides through metamorphosis, a trait that has been optimized in monarch butterflies to deter predators17–19. The order in which the substitutions evolved was explained by amelioration of antagonistic pleiotropy through epistasis13,14,20–22. Our study illuminates how the monarch butterfly evolved resistance to a class of plant toxins, eventually becoming unpalatable, and changing the nature of species interactions within ecological communities2,6–11,15,17–19.},

We found that deletions in a single gene, spalt, are sufficient to reduce or completely delete eyespot colour patterns, thus demonstrating a positive regulatory role for this gene in eyespot determination. Conversely, and contrary to previous predictions, deletions in Distal-less (Dll) result in an increase in the size and number of eyespots, illustrating a repressive role for this gene in eyespot development. Altogether our results show that the presence, absence and shape of butterfly eyespots can be controlled by the activity of two co-opted transcription factors.},

However, in Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) RNAi has many times proven to be difficult to achieve. Most of the negative results have been anecdotal and the positive experiments have not been collected in such a way that they are possible to analyze. In this review, we have collected detailed data from more than 150 experiments including all to date published and many unpublished experiments. Despite a large variation in the data, trends that are found are that RNAi is particularly successful in the family Saturniidae and in genes involved in immunity. On the contrary, gene expression in epidermal tissues seems to be most difficult to silence. In addition, gene silencing by feeding dsRNA requires high concentrations for success. Possible causes for the variability of success in RNAi experiments in Lepidoptera are discussed. The review also points to a need to further investigate the mechanism of RNAi in lepidopteran insects and its possible connection to the innate immune response.

We use a database of citizen science bird observations to explore spatiotemporal variation in mean arrival dates across an unprecedented geographic extent for 18 common species in North America over the past decade, relating arrival dates to mean minimum spring temperature. Across all species and geographic locations, species shifted arrival dates 0.8 days earlier for every °C of warming of spring temperature, but it was common for some species in some locations to shift as much as 3-6 days earlier per °C. Species that advanced arrival dates the earliest in response to warming were those that migrate more slowly, short distance migrants, and species with broader climatic niches. These three variables explained 63\% of the interspecific variation in phenological response. We also identify a latitudinal gradient in the average strength of phenological response, with species shifting arrival earlier at southern latitudes than northern latitudes for the same degree of warming. This observation is consistent with the idea that species must be more phenologically sensitive in less seasonal environments to maintain the same degree of precision in phenological timing. © 2012 Hurlbert, Liang.},

The eastern North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), whose genome is sequenced, has emerged as a model to study animal clocks, navigational mechanisms, and the genetic basis of long-distance migration. Here, we developed a highly efficient gene-targeting approach in the monarch using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), engineered nucleases that generate mutations at targeted genomic sequences. We focused our ZFN approach on targeting the type 2 vertebrate-like cryptochrome gene of the monarch (designated cry2 ), which encodes a putative transcriptional repressor of the monarch circadian clockwork. Co-injections of mRNAs encoding ZFNs targeting the second exon of monarch cry2 into "one nucleus" stage embryos led to high-frequency nonhomologous end-joining-mediated, mutagenic lesions in the germline (up to 50\%). Heritable ZFN-induced lesions in two independent lines produced truncated, nonfunctional CRY2 proteins, resulting in the in vivo disruption of circadian behavior and the molecular clock mechanism. Our work genetically defines CRY2 as an essential transcriptional repressor of the monarch circadian clock and provides a proof of concept for the use of ZFNs for manipulating genes in the monarch butterfly genome. Importantly, this approach could be used in other lepidopterans and "nonmodel" insects, thus opening new avenues to decipher the molecular underpinnings of a variety of biological processes.},

	abstract = {A species distribution combines the resources and climatic tolerances that allow an individual or population to persist. As these conditions change, one mechanism to maintain favorable resources is for an organism to shift its range. Much of the research examining range shifts has focused on dynamic distribution boundaries wheras the role of species breeding habitat or migration strategies on shift tendencies has received less attention. We expand on previous research by using a large suite of avian species (i.e., 277), analyzing observed abundance-weighted average latitudes, and categorizing species by breeding environment and migration strategy. We used the North American Breeding Bird Survey dataset to address two questions: (1) Has the center of observed abundance for individual species shifted latitudinally? (2) Is there a relationship between migration strategy or breeding habitat and range shifts? Results indicate the majority of species have experienced poleward range shifts over the last 43 years, and birds breeding in all habitat showed trends of poleward shift but only those species breeding in scrub-shrub and grassland environments were different from zero. Additionally, species that are short distance migrants are experiencing significant poleward shifts while Neotropical and permanent residents had shifts that were not different from zero. Our findings do support the general trend expected from climate driven changes (i.e., {\textgreater} 52 \% shifting poleward), however, the proportion of species exhibiting equatorial shifts (24 \%) or no significant shifts (23 \%) illustrates the complex interplay between land cover, climate, species interactions, and other forces that can interact to influence breeding ranges over time. Regardless of the mechanisms driving range shifts, our findings emphasize the need for connecting and expanding habitats for those species experiencing range shifts. This research describes the patterns of breeding birds through central North America and we encourage future research to focus on the mechanisms driving these patterns.},

Process-based hydrological models, however, have thus far shown limited power to replicate observed large-scale variation in U.S. surface water isotope ratios. Here we develop a geographic information system-based model to predict long-term annual average surface water isotope ratios across the contiguous United States. We use elevation-explicit, gridded precipitation isotope maps as model input and data from a U.S. Geological Survey monitoring program for validation. We find that models incorporating monthly variation in precipitation-evapotranspiration (P-E) amounts account for the majority ({\textgreater}89\%) of isotopic variation and have reduced regional bias relative to models that do not consider intra-annual P-E effects on catchment water balance. Residuals from the water balance model exhibit strong spatial patterning and correlations that suggest model residuals isolate additional hydrological signal. We use interpolated model residuals to generate optimized prediction maps for U.S. surface water δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H and δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O values. We show that the modeled surface water values represent a relatively accurate and unbiased proxy for drinking water isotope ratios across the United States, making these data products useful in ecological and criminal forensics applications that require estimates of the local environmental water isotope variation across large geographic regions.

Data on the abundance of adult and immature stages in the Maghreb in 2014–2016 are used to test several hypotheses regarding the autumn migration of this species. 3. A strong seasonal migratory strategy was confirmed by the all but total absence of the species in NW Africa at the end of summer and the arrival of huge numbers migrants in October and November. Migration was timed to coincide with an increase in host plant availability but not with any increase in nectar sources. 4. Flower abundance was the main predictor of adult abundance in autumn, with Ditrichia viscosa, Verbesina encelioides, and Medicago sativa being key resources that attracted enormous numbers of butterflies to oases, ruderal habitats, and oueds. The distribution of immature stages was strongly predicted by host plant abundance (with traditional agriculture representing the most important breeding habitat) and latitude (most breeding occurred in the south of the region). Also, both adults and immature stages were more common inland than in coastal areas. 5. Changes in age structure of the adult population were also noted. The number of fresh adults slowly increased, indicating that butterflies did not return in a single wave and that the first offspring of the first returners were already emerging when some butterflies were still arriving.},

Here, we aim at disentangling the effects of climate, land-use, and geographical drivers on aphid abundance and phenology in France, at a regional scale and over the last 40 years. We used aerial data obtained from suction traps between 1978 and 2015 on five aphid species varying in their degree of specialization to legumes, along with climate, legume crop area and geographical data. Effects of environmental and geographical variables on aphid annual abundance and spring migration dates were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. We found that within the last four decades, aphids have advanced their spring migration by a month, mostly due to the increase in temperature early in the year, and their abundance decreased by half on average, presumably in response to a combination of factors. The influence of legume crop area decreased with the degree of specialization of the aphid species to such crops. The effect of geographical variation was high even when controlling for environmental variables, suggesting that many other spatially structured processes act on aphid population characteristics. Multifactorial analyses helped to partition the effects of different global change drivers. Climate and land-use changes have strong effects on aphid populations, with important implications for future agriculture. Additionally, trait-based response variation could have major consequences at the community scale.},

	abstract = {The migratory monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of eastern North America have undergone large-scale declines, which may be attributable to a variety of underlying causes. The uncertainty about the primary cause of declines and whether individual threats are likely to increase in the future presents challenges for developing effective conservation management and policy initiatives that aim to improve population viability. This paper identifies five potential threats and classifies these threats according to the types of studies (observational, experimental, simulation/models) and their current impact and anticipated risk. Broadly, the threats can be classified into five categories: (1) change in suitable abiotic environmental conditions; (2) deforestation in the overwintering range; (3) exposure to contaminants including the bacteria Bacillus thuringiensis, herbicides, and insecticides; (4) loss of breeding habitat; and (5) predation, parasitism, and species-specific pathogens. The vast distribution of the monarch butterfly makes it likely that population declines are attributed to a suite of interacting factors that vary spatially and temporally in their contribution. Nonetheless, the published papers we reviewed suggest the decline in suitable environmental conditions in addition to overwintering (i.e., deforestation) and breeding habitat loss are the most likely threats to continue to affect the population viability of monarch butterflies.},

	abstract = {Humans challenge the phenotypic, genetic, and cultural makeup of species by affecting the fitness landscapes on which they evolve. Recent studies show that cities might play a major role in contemporary evolution by accelerating phenotypic changes in wildlife, including animals, plants, fungi, and other organisms. Many studies of ecoevolutionary change have focused on anthropogenic drivers, but none of these studies has specifically examined the role that urbanization plays in ecoevolution or explicitly examined its mechanisms. This paper presents evidence on the mechanisms linking urban development patterns to rapid evolutionary changes for species that play important functional roles in communities and ecosystems. Through a metaanalysis of experimental and observational studies reporting more than 1,600 phenotypic changes in species across multiple regions, we ask whether we can discriminate an urban signature of phenotypic change beyond the established natural baselines and other anthropogenic signals. We then assess the relative impact of five types of urban disturbances including habitat modifications, biotic interactions, habitat heterogeneity, novel disturbances, and social interactions. Our study shows a clear urban signal; rates of phenotypic change are greater in urbanizing systems compared with natural and nonurban anthropogenic systems. By explicitly linking urban development to traits that affect ecosystem function, we can map potential ecoevolutionary implications of emerging patterns of urban agglomerations and uncover insights for maintaining key ecosystem functions upon which the sustainability of human well-being depends.},

However, one of the main advantages of using 87Sr/86Sr values, that there is no fractionation from geological bedrock sources through the food web, also happens to be a critical assumption that has never been tested experimentally. We test this assumption by measuring 87Sr/86Sr values across three trophic levels in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Adult monarch butterflies were raised on obligate larval host milkweed plants that were, in turn, grown on seven different soil types collected across Canada. We found no significant differences between 87Sr/86Sr values in leachable Sr from soil minerals, organic soil, milkweed leaves, and monarch butterfly wings. Our results suggest that strontium isoscapes developed from 87Sr/86Sr values in bedrock or soil may serve as a reliable biological marker in forensic science for a range of taxa and across large geographic a...},

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), elemental analysis (EA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray diffraction (EDX) were used to investigate physicochemical characteristics of chitin samples. FT-IR spectra revealed that the moth chitin had a-chitin form (anti-parallel chains) with respect to the different orientations of its microfibrils. The degree of acetylation of chitin from moth and shrimp calculated using the FT-IR stretching bands were 70.82\% and 71.42\%, respectively. The SEM observation exhibited the presence of fibrillar material and porous structures in surface of the chitin samples. EDX analysis revealed that the main elements present in the moth chitin (beyond C, O and N) were Br (10.5\%) and Si (9.7\%).

	abstract = {The exponential increase of mobile telephony has led to a pronounced increase in electromagnetic fields in the environment that may affect pollinator communities and threaten pollination as a key ecosystem service. Previous studies conducted on model species under laboratory conditions have shown negative effects of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on reproductive success, development, and navigation of insects. However, the potential effects that widespread mobile telecommunication antennas have on wild pollinator communities outside the laboratory microcosm are still unknown. Here we studied the effects of EMR from telecommunication antennas on key wild pollinator groups (wild bees, hoverflies, bee flies, remaining flies, beetles, butterflies, and wasps). We measured EMR at 4 distances (50, 100, 200 and 400 m) from 10 antennas (5 on Limnos Island and 5 on Lesvos Island, eastern Mediterranean, Greece), and correlated EMR values with insect abundance and richness (the latter only for wild bees and hoverflies). All pollinator groups except butterflies were affected by EMR. In both islands, beetle, wasp, and hoverfly abundance decreased with EMR, whereas the abundance of underground-nesting wild bees and bee flies unexpectedly increased with EMR. The effect of EMR on the abundance of remaining flies differed between islands. With respect to species richness, EMR only tended to have a negative effect on hoverflies in Limnos. As EMR affected the abundance of several insect guilds negatively, and changed the composition of wild pollinators in natural habitats, it might also have additional ecological and economic impacts on the maintenance of wild plant diversity, crop production and human welfare.},

We tested the hypothesis that honey bees sense the polarity of magnetic fields. We created an engineered magnetic anomaly in which the magnetic field generally either converged toward a sugar reward in a watch glass, or away from it. After bees in behavioral field studies had learned to associate this anomaly with a sugar water reward, we subjected them to two experiments performed in random order. In both experiments, we presented bees with two identical sugar water rewards, one of which was randomly marked by a magnetic field anomaly. During the control experiment, the polarity of the magnetic field anomaly was maintained the same as it was during the training session. During the treatment experiment, it was reversed. We predicted that bees would not respond to the altered anomaly if they were sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. Our findings that bees continued to respond to the magnetic anomaly when its polarity was in its unaltered state, but did not respond to it when its polarity was reversed, support the hypothesis that honey bees possess a polarity-sensitive magnetoreceptor.},

Subjecting lyophilized and pelletized bee tagmata to analyses by a superconducting quantum interference device generated a distinct hysteresis loop for the abdomen but not for the thorax or the head of bees, indicating the presence of ferromagnetic material in the bee abdomen. Magnetic remanence of abdomen pellets produced from bees that were, or were not, exposed to the 2.2-kOe field of a magnet while alive differed, indicating that magnet exposure altered the magnetization of this magnetite in live bees. In behavioural two-choice field experiments, bees briefly exposed to the same magnet, but not sham-treated control bees, failed to sense a custom-generated magnetic anomaly, indicating that magnet exposure had rendered the bees’ magnetoreceptor dysfunctional. Our data support the conclusion that honey bees possess a magnetite-based magnetoreceptor located in the abdomen.},

At least 23 Columbian mammoths (Mammuthus columbi), along with the remains of 12 other vertebrate genera have been discovered at this locality. Mammoth teeth were micro-sampled at a high resolution with a computerized micromill, whereas bison and horse teeth were serially sampled with a handheld rotary tool. Serial samples from these individuals offer insights into the movement patterns (87Sr/86Sr) of WMNM herbivores. Regional vegetation and local sediments were also collected to construct an 87Sr/86Sr isoscape to track past movement of mammals, derived from Sr analyses of teeth enamel. 87Sr/86Sr in WMNM herbivores often reflects multiple grazing provenances, and sources. A series of mixing models are proposed to understand the contribution of different surface Sr sources to herbivore diets. These data indicate one mammoth spent some time at the Llano uplift area {\textasciitilde}180 km to the SSW during the formation of molar enamel. The remaining individuals (three mammoths, a bison and a horse) lived in an area more proximal to the WMNM, ≤70 km SE of the site. 87Sr/86Sr from WMNM mammoths indicate individual fidelity to at least two geographic ranges, with at least one mammoth, potentially unrelated to the possible matriarchal herd, indicating complex population dynamics prior to mass mortality. This analysis shows that at least 25 mammals, including the horse and bison, congregated at the confluence of Brazos and Bosque rivers at {\textasciitilde}67 ka ago, prior to their demise. A resource shortage related to drought is consistent with this pattern.},

However, trace element analysis of keratinized tissues is complicated by the lack of reference endogenous ranges of trace element and the lack of understanding of the susceptibility of each element to exogenous contamination. The interior of animal horn is the cleanest of all keratinized tissues with minimum exogenous contamination because of its large size. Thus, the trace element concentrations in horn interior samples can provide reliable endogenous concentration ranges. Here we measured the concentrations of trace elements in horn interior samples of cattle and wild animals, which we propose to be used as the reference ranges for endogenous levels of trace elements in keratin. We calculated the enrichment factors of 30 trace elements in horn interior samples relative to the continental crust, which we considered the average exogenous contamination. We compared the ranges of elemental concentrations measured in horn interior samples, in the order of decreasing enrichment factor, to their reference ranges in hair, fingernails, and toenails, as well as their concentrations in caprine horns. Such comparison validates the use of the enrichment factor as an indicator of the susceptibility of an element to contamination: an element with a high enrichment factor is generally less likely to be affected by contamination and vice versa.},

Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs. However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species are likely to harbour the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis of mammalian host-virus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy and human population within a species range - which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate that bats harbour a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We also identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people.},

Multiple transmission routes have been proposed as one mechanism by which virulent pathogens can achieve high prevalence, underscoring the need to investigate this hypothesis through an integrated modelling-empirical framework. Here, we examine a harmful specialist protozoan infecting monarch butterflies that commonly reaches high prevalence (50–100\%) in resident populations. We integrate field and modelling work to show that a combination of three empirically-supported transmission routes (vertical, adult transfer and environmental transmission) can produce and sustain high infection prevalence in this system. Although horizontal transmission is necessary for parasite invasion, most new infections post-establishment arise from vertical transmission. Our study predicts that multiple transmission routes, coupled with high parasite virulence, can reduce resident host abundance by up to 50\%, suggesting that the protozoan could contribute to declines of North American monarchs.},

A key challenge involves determining how motile parasites select among potential hosts and the degree to which this process shifts with community composition. Focusing on interactions between larval amphibians and the pathogenic trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae, we designed a novel, large-volume set of choice chambers to assess how the selectivity of free-swimming infectious parasites varied among five host species and in response to changes in assemblage composition (four different permutations). In a second set of trials, cercariae were allowed to contact and infect hosts, allowing comparison of host-parasite encounter rates (parasite choice) with infection outcomes (successful infections). Cercariae exhibited consistent preferences for specific host species that were independent of the community context; large-bodied amphibians, such as larval bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), exhibited the highest level of parasite attraction. However, because host attractiveness was decoupled from susceptibility to infection, assemblage composition sharply affected both per-host infection as well as total infection (summed among co-occurring hosts). Species such as the non-native R. catesbeiana functioned as epidemiological 'sinks’ or dilution hosts, attracting a disproportionate fraction of parasites relative to the number that established successfully, whereas Taricha granulosa and especially Pseudacris regilla supported comparatively more metacercariae relative to cercariae selection. These findings provide a framework for integrating information on parasite preference in combination with more traditional factors such as host competence and density to forecast how changes within complex communities will affect parasite transmission.},

To investigate if the genetic makeup of one or a set of these candidate genes can be used to identify a general pattern between migratory and non-migratory birds, we extracted genomic sequence data for 25 hypothesised candidate genes for migration from 70 available genomes across all orders of Aves and characterised sequence divergence between migratory and non-migratory phenotypes. When examining each gene separately across all species, we did not identify any genetic variants in candidate genes that distinguished migrants from non-migrants; any resulting pattern was driven by the phylogenetic signal. This was true for each gene analysed independently, but also for concatenated sequence alignments of all candidate genes combined. We also attempted to distinguish between migrant and non-migrants using structural features at four candidate genes that have previously been reported to show associated with migratory behaviour but did not pick up a signal for migratory phenotype here either. Finally, a screen for dN/dS ratio across all focal candidate genes to probe for putative features of selection did not uncover a pattern, though this might not be expected given the broad phylogenetic scale used here. Our study demonstrates the potential of public genomic data to test for general patterns of migratory gene candidates in a cross-species comparative context, and raise questions on the applicability of candidate gene approaches in a macro-evolutionary context to understand the genetic architecture of migratory behaviour.},

Drawing on examples from the literature, with primary emphasis on three diverse host-parasite case studies, we first examine current understanding of the spatial structure of host and parasite populations, including patterns of local adaptation and spatial variation in host resistance and parasite infectivity. We then explore the ways to measure temporal variation and dynamics in host-parasite interactions and discuss the need to examine change over both ecological and evolutionary timescales. Finally, we highlight new approaches and syntheses that allow for simultaneous analysis of dynamics across scales.

We parameterized this model with observations from moths captured in traps or observed migrating under field conditions. We further documented the effects of prior defoliation on the size and weight (including fecundity) of migrating moths. Our simulations under idealized nocturnal conditions with a stable atmospheric boundary layer suggest that the ability of gravid female moths to migrate is conditional on the progression of egg-laying. The model also predicts that the altitude at which moths migrate varies with the temperature profile in the boundary layer and with time during the evening and night. Model results have implications for the degree to which long-distance dispersal by spruce budworm might influence population dynamics in locations distant from outbreak sources, including how atmospheric phenomena such as wind convergence might influence these processes. To simulate actual migration flights en masse, the proposed model will need to be linked to regional maps of insect populations, a phenology model, and weather model outputs of both large- and small-scale atmospheric conditions.},

It plays a key role in many processes at the Earth surface, especially the fluxes of matter to soils, ecosystems, rivers, and oceans. Understanding these processes at the global scale requires a high resolution description of lithology. A new high resolution global lithological map (GLiM) was assembled from existing regional geological maps translated into lithological information with the help of regional literature. The GLiM represents the rock types of the Earth surface with 1,235,400 polygons. The lithological classification consists of three levels. The first level contains 16 lithological classes comparable to previously applied definitions in global lithological maps. The additional two levels contain 12 and 14 subclasses, respectively, which describe more specific rock attributes. According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64\% sediments (a third of which are carbonates), 13\% metamorphics, 7\% plutonics, and 6\% volcanics, and 10\% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales. A gridded version of the GLiM is available at the PANGEA Database (http://dx.doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.788537).},

	abstract = {Agriculture has had a tremendous impact on soil nutrients around the world. In some regions, soil nutrients are depleted because of low initial soil fertility or excessive nutrient removals through intense land use relative to nutrient additions. In other regions, application of chemical fertilizers and manure has led to an accumulation of nutrients and subsequent water quality problems. Understanding the current level and spatial patterns of fertilizer and manure inputs would greatly improve the ability to identify areas that might be sensitive to aquatic eutrophication or to nutrient depletion. The authors calculated spatially explicit fertilizer inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) by fusing national-level statistics on fertilizer use with global maps of harvested area for 175 crops. They also calculated spatially explicit manure inputs of N and P by fusing globalmaps of animal density and international data on manure production and nutrient content. Significantly higher application rates were found for both fertilizers and manures in the Northern Hemisphere, with maxima centered on areas with intensive cropland and high densities of livestock. Furthermore, nutrient use is confined to a fewmajor hot spots, with approximately 10\% of the treated land receiving over 50\% of the use of both fertilizers and manures. The authors' new spatial disaggregation of the rich International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) fertilizer-use dataset will provide new and interesting avenues to explore the impact of anthropogenic activity on ecosystems at the global scale and may also have implications for policies designed to improve soil quality or reduce nutrient runoff.

Sampling and analytical protocols were developed at a workshop in 2003, and pilot studies were conducted from 2004 to 2007 to test and refine these recommended protocols. The final sampling protocol for the national-scale survey included, at each site, a sample from a depth of 0 to 5 centimeters, a composite of the soil A horizon, and a deeper sample from the soil C horizon or, if the top of the C horizon was at a depth greater than 1 meter, from a depth of approximately 80–100 centimeters. The {\textless}2-millimeter fraction of each sample was analyzed for a suite of 45 major and trace elements by methods that yield the total or near-total elemental content. The major mineralogi- cal components in the samples from the soil A and C horizons were determined by a quantitative X-ray diffraction method using Rietveld refinement. Sampling in the conterminous United States was completed in 2010, with chemical and mineralogical analyses completed in May 2013. The result- ing dataset provides an estimate of the abundance and spatial distribution of chemical elements and minerals in soils of the conterminous United States and represents a baseline for soil geochemistry and mineralogy against which future changes may be recognized and quantified.

The adult is not searching for anything, and migratory flight is not terminated by encounters with potential resources. Many insect pests of agricultural crops are long-distance migrants, moving from lower latitudes where they overwinter to higher latitudes in the spring to exploit superabundant, but seasonally ephemeral, host crops. The migratory nature of these pests is somewhat easy to recognize because of their sudden appearance in areas where they had been absent only a day or two earlier. Many other serious pests survive hostile winter conditions by diapausing, and therefore do not require migration to move between overwintering and breeding ranges. Yet there is evidence of migratory behavior engaged in by several pest species that inhabit high latitudes year-round. In these cases, the consequences of migratory flight are not immediately noticeable at the population level, because migration takes place for the most part within their larger year-round distribution. Nevertheless, the potential population-level consequences can be quite important in the contexts of pest management and insect resistance management. As a case study, I review the evidence for migratory flight behavior by individual European corn borer adults, and discuss the importance of understanding it. The kind of migratory behavior posited for pest species inhabiting a permanent distribution may be more common than we realize.},

	abstract = {Many parasitic infections increase the morbidity and mortality of host populations. Interactions between co-infecting parasites can influence virulence, the damage done to a host. Previous studies investigating the impacts of parasite co-infection on hosts have been limited by their inability to control parasite dosage, use consistent virulence metrics, or verify co-infection status. This study used molecular tools, known infection dosage, and multiple assessments over time to test whether parasite relatedness can predict virulence in co-infections, as well as whether competitive interactions between different parasite strains within a host are predictable over time. In addition, we examined the impacts of other parasite traits, such as infectivity, as alternative predictors of virulence and competition outcomes. Hosts with single-strain (related) parasite infections were found to have lower virulence in terms of host and parasite reproduction, supporting kin selection predictions. However, these infections also resulted in higher host mortality. We argue that mortality should not be used as a measurement of virulence in parasite systems that castrate hosts. Hosts were more susceptible to mixed strain (unrelated) parasite infections, indicating that co-infections may make resistance more costly to hosts. Co-infections were dynamic, with changes in parasite dominance over the course of the infection. The more infective parasite strain appeared to suppress the less infective strain, ultimately increasing host longevity. Our findings suggest that unrelated, or more diverse, parasite infections are associated with higher virulence, but that studies must consider their methodology and possible alternative explanations beyond kin selection to understand virulence outcomes.},

	abstract = {We present a new global model for the Earth's crust based on seismic refraction data published in the period 1948-1995 and a detailed compilation of ice and sediment thickness. An extensive compilation of seismic refraction measurements has been used to determine the crustal structure on continents and their margins. Oceanic crust is modeled with both a standard model for normal oceanic crust, and variants for nonstandard regions, such as oceanic plateaus. Our model (CRUST 5.1) consists of 2592 5° × 5° tiles in which the crust and uppermost mantle are described by eight layers: (1) ice, (2) water, (3) soft sediments, (4) hard sediments, (5) crystalline upper, (6) middle, (7) lower crust, and (8) uppermost mantle. Topography and bathymetry are adopted from a Mandard database (ETOPO-5). Compressional wave velocity in each layer is based on field measurements, and shear wave velocity and density are estimated using recently published empirical Vp-Vs and Vp -density relationships. The crustal model differs from previous models in that (1) the thickness and seismic/density structure of sedimentary basins is accounted for more completely, (2) the velocity structure of unmeasured regions is estimated using statistical averages that are based on a significantly larger database of crustal structure, (3) the compressional wave, shear wave, and density structure have been explicitly specified using newly available constraints from field and laboratory studies. Thus - this global crustal model is based on substantially more data than previous models and differs from them in many important respects. A new map of the thickness of the Earth's crust is presented, and we illustrate the application of this model by using it to provide the crustal correction for surface wave phase velocity maps. Love waves at 40 s are dominantly sensitive to crustal structure, and there is a very close correspondence between observed phase velocities at this period and those predicted by CRUST 5.1. We find that the application of crustal corrections to long-period (167 s) Rayleigh waves significantly increases the variance in the phase velocity maps and strengthens the upper mantle , velocity anomalies beneath stable continental regions. A simple calculation of crustal isostacy indicates significant lateral variations in upper mantle density. The model CRUST 5.1 provides a complete description of the physical properties of the Earth's crust at a scale of 5° × 5° and can be used for a wide range of seismological and nonseismological problems.},

Terrestrial sediment records from the last glacial maximum compiled here indicate a large underestimate of deposition in continental regions, probably due to the lack of simulation of glaciogenic dust sources. In order to include the glaciogenic dust sources as a first approximation, we designate the location of these sources, and infer the size of the sources using an inversion method that best matches the available data. The inclusion of these inferred glaciogenic dust sources increases our dust flux in the last glacial maximum from 2.1 to 3.3 times current deposition.},

	abstract = {Migrations of diverse wildlife species often converge in space and time, with their journeys shaped by similar forces (i.e. geographic barriers and seasonal resources and conditions); we term this 'co-migration'. Recent studies have illuminated multi-speciesmigrations by land and sea including the simultaneous movements of numerous insects, birds, bats and of fish invertebrates marine predators. Beyond their significance as natural wonders, species with overlapping migrations may interact ecologically, with potential effects on population and community dynamics. Direct and indirect ecological interactions (including predation and competition) between migrant species remain poorly understood, in part because migration is the least-studied phase of ani-mals' annual cycles. To address this gap, we conducted a literature review to examine whether animal migration studies incorporate multiple species and to what extent they investigate interspecific interactions between co-migrants. Following a key word search, we read all migration research papers in 23 relevant peer-reviewed journals during 2008-2017. Thirty percent of animal migration papers reported two or more species with coinciding migrations, suggesting that co-migrations are common, although few studies investigated or discussed these mixed-species migrations further. Synthesizing these, we present examples and describe five types of ecological interactions between migrating species, including predator-prey, host-parasite and commensal relationships. Considering migratory animals as interacting with migrant communities will enhance understanding of the drivers of migration and could improve predictions about wildlife responses to global change. Further research focused on multi-species migrations could also inform conservation efforts for migratory animal populations, many of which are declining or shifting, with unexplored consequences for other co-migratory species.},

	abstract = {A global assessment of precipitation chemistry and deposition has been carried out under the direction of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Scientific Advisory Group for Precipitation Chemistry (SAG-PC). The assessment addressed three questions: (1) what do measurements and model estimates of precipitation chemistry and wet, dry and total deposition of sulfur, nitrogen, sea salt, base cations, organic acids, acidity, and phosphorus show globally and regionally? (2) has the wet deposition of major ions changed since 2000 (and, where information and data are available, since 1990) and (3) what are the major gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge? To that end, regionally-representative measurements for two 3-year-averaging periods, 2000-2002 and 2005-2007, were compiled worldwide. Data from the 2000-2002 averaging period were combined with 2001 ensemble-mean modeling results from 21 global chemical transport models produced in Phase 1 of the Coordinated Model Studies Activities of the Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution (TF HTAP). The measurement data and modeling results were used to generate global and regional maps of major ion concentrations in precipitation and deposition. A major product of the assessment is a database of quality assured ion concentration and wet deposition data gathered from regional and national monitoring networks. The database is available for download from the World Data Centre for Precipitation Chemistry (http://wdcpc.org/). The assessment concludes that global concentrations and deposition of sulfur and nitrogen are reasonably well characterized with levels generally highest near emission sources and more than an order of magnitude lower in areas largely free of anthropogenic influences. In many parts of the world, wet deposition of reduced nitrogen exceeds that of oxidized nitrogen and is increasing. Sulfur and nitrogen concentrations and deposition in North America and Europe have declined significantly in line with emission reduction policies. Major regions of the world, including South America, the more remote areas of North America, much of Asia, Africa, Oceania, polar regions, and all of the oceans, are inadequately sampled for all of the major ions in wet and dry deposition, and particularly so for phosphorus, organic forms of nitrogen, and weak acids including carbonates and organic acids. Measurement-based inferential estimates of dry deposition are limited to sulfur and some nitrogen in only a few regions of the world and methods are highly uncertain. The assessment concludes with recommendations to address major gaps and uncertainties in global ion concentration and deposition measurements. © 2013.},

	abstract = {Mapped unconsolidated sediments cover half of the global land surface. They are of considerable importance for many Earth surface processes like weathering, hydrological fluxes or biogeochemical cycles. Ignoring their characteristics or spatial extent may lead to misinterpretations in Earth System studies. Therefore, a new Global Unconsolidated Sediments Map database (GUM) was compiled, using regional maps specifically representing unconsolidated and quaternary sediments. The new GUM database provides insights into the regional distribution of unconsolidated sediments and their properties. The GUM comprises 911,551 polygons and describes not only sediment types and subtypes, but also parameters like grain size, mineralogy, age and thickness where available. Previous global lithological maps or databases lacked detail for reported unconsolidated sediment areas or missed large areas, and reported a global coverage of 25 to 30\%, considering the ice‐free land area. Here, alluvial sediments cover about 23\% of the mapped total ice‐free area, followed by aeolian sediments (∼21\%), glacial sediments (∼20\%), and colluvial sediments (∼16\%). A specific focus during the creation of the database was on the distribution of loess deposits, since loess is highly reactive and relevant to understand geochemical cycles related to dust deposition and weathering processes. An additional layer compiling pyroclastic sediment is added, which merges consolidated and unconsolidated pyroclastic sediments. The compilation shows latitudinal abundances of sediment types related to climate of the past. The GUM database is available at the PANGAEA database.},

	doi = {10.1002/joc.1276},
	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

	abstract = {Within the Kyoto Protocol, the clean development mechanism (CDM) is an instrument intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development, with the multiple goals of poverty reduction, environmental benefits and cost-effective emission reductions. The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon 'sink' projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27\% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	isbn = {3-540-26603-8},
	abstract = {Insects migrate in many different scales ranging from a few metres to many hundreds of kilometres. The holistic conceptual model hosts a suite of widely accepted definition of insect migration. The predisposition of some insects for migration is called migratory syndrome and involves the condition of the flight muscles, the oviposition period and timing, the fecundity, the energy uptake and wing polymorphism. Pheromones are another useful trait of migratory insects since they are used to gather the scattered migrants in a restricted space. The cost of a migration event was compared to the cost of other solutions to the problems of overcrowding or habitat destruction. In many cases migration is the less costly solution apart from other benefits that may incur to the insect such as natural selection, since migration is a safe estimator of the abilities of the insect and its health status. To estimate the cost of insect migration several authors have proposed formulas with hardly estimable parameters. Moreover, it is very difficult for the insect to manipulate parameters such as the migration time and the available energy for migration. It is speculated that in evolutionary time, the manipulation in evolutionary time of some parameters is not possible in the physiological context of an insect, and for this, a migration event may last more than two or three generations. The migration of insects is now studied using, apart from biological methods, new approaches such as specifically constructed entomological radars. Climate change in general and global warming in particular affect insect migration in several ways. It causes phenological shifts to the host plants, destruction of habitat, extensive fragmentation of landscapes, marine incursions and faunal reshuffling. Also, many insects and host plants are responding in different ways to global warming and greenhouse gases. In Mediterranean insects such as Euplagia quadripunctaria there is a short scale migration primarily caused by searching for ideal climatic conditions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Partial migration—wherein migratory and non-migratory individuals exist within the same population—represents a behavioural dimorphism; for it to persist over time, both strategies should yield equal individual fitness. This balance may be maintained through trade-offs where migrants gain survival benefits by avoiding unfavourable conditions, while residents gain breeding benefits from early access to resources. There has been little overarching quantitative analysis of the evidence for this fitness balance. As migrants—especially long-distance migrants—may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change, it is possible that recent anthropogenic impacts could drive shifts in fitness balances within these populations. We tested these predictions using a multi-taxa meta-analysis. Of 2,939 reviewed studies, 23 contained suitable information for meta-analysis, yielding 129 effect sizes. Of these, 73\% (n = 94) reported higher resident fitness, 22\% (n = 28) reported higher migrant fitness, and 5\% (n = 7) reported equal fitness. Once weighted for precision, we found balanced fitness benefits across the entire dataset, but a consistently higher fitness of residents over migrants in birds and herpetofauna (the best-sampled groups). Residency benefits were generally associated with survival, not breeding success, and increased with the number of years of data over which effect sizes were calculated, suggesting deviations from fitness parity are not due to sampling artefacts. A pervasive survival benefit to residency documented in recent literature could indicate that increased exposure to threats associated with anthropogenic change faced by migrating individuals may be shifting the relative fitness balance between strategies.},

In an effort to aid population recovery, monarch enthusiasts across North America participate in a variety of conservation efforts, including captive rearing and release of monarch butterflies throughout the summer and autumn. However, the impact of captive breeding on monarchs remains an open question. Here, we show that captive breeding, both commercially and by summertime hobbyists, causes migratory behavior to be lost. Monarchs acquired commercially failed to orient south when reared outdoors in the autumn, unlike wild-caught North American monarchs, yet they did enter reproductive diapause. The commercial population was genetically highly divergent from wild-caught North American monarchs and had rounder forewings, similar to monarchs from nonmigratory populations. Furthermore, rearing wild-caught monarchs in an indoor environment mimicking natural migration-inducing conditions failed to elicit southward flight orientation. In fact, merely eclosing indoors after an otherwise complete lifecycle outdoors was enough to disrupt southern orientation. Our results provide a window into the complexity—and remarkable fragility—of migration.},

We raised offspring of wild-caught monarchs on swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) and, after eclosion, individuals were either tested in a flight simulator or radio-tracked in the wild using array of over 100 automated telemetry towers. While only 33\% (7/39) of monarchs tested in the flight simulator showed strong southeast to southwest orientation, 97\% (28/29) of the radio-tracked individuals were detected by automated towers south or southeast of the release site, up to 200 km away.

	doi = {10.1007/s00190-011-0533-4},
	abstract = {The availability of high-resolution global digital elevation data sets has raised a growing interest in the feasibility of obtaining their spherical harmonic representation at matching resolution, and from there in the modelling of induced gravity perturbations. We have therefore estimated spherical Bouguer and Airy isostatic anomalies whose spherical harmonic models are derived from the Earth's topography harmonic expansion. These spherical anomalies differ from the classical planar ones and may be used in the context of new applications. We succeeded in meeting a number of challenges to build spherical harmonic models with no theoretical limitation on the resolution. A specific algorithm was developed to enable the computation of associated Legendre functions to any degree and order. It was successfully tested up to degree 32,400. All analyses and syntheses were performed, in 64 bits arithmetic and with semi-empirical control of the significant terms to prevent from calculus underflows and overflows, according to IEEE limitations, also in preserving the speed of a specific regular grid processing scheme. Finally, the continuation from the reference ellipsoid's surface to the Earth's surface was performed by high-order Taylor expansion with all grids of required partial derivatives being computed in parallel. The main application was the production of a 1′ × 1′ equiangular global Bouguer anomaly grid which was computed by spherical harmonic analysis of the Earth's topography-bathymetry ETOPO1 data set up to degree and order 10,800, taking into account the precise boundaries and densities of major lakes and inner seas, with their own altitude, polar caps with bedrock information, and land areas below sea level. The harmonic coefficients for each entity were derived by analyzing the corresponding ETOPO1 part, and free surface data when required, at one arc minute resolution. The following approximations were made: the land, ocean and ice cap gravity spherical harmonic coefficients were computed up to the third degree of the altitude, and the harmonics of the other, smaller parts up to the second degree. Their sum constitutes what we call ETOPG1, the Earth's TOPography derived Gravity model at 1′ resolution (half-wavelength). The EGM2008 gravity field model and ETOPG1 were then used to rigorously compute 1′ × 1′ point values of surface gravity anomalies and disturbances, respectively, worldwide, at the real Earth's surface, i. e. at the lower limit of the atmosphere. The disturbance grid is the most interesting product of this study and can be used in various contexts. The surface gravity anomaly grid is an accurate product associated with EGM2008 and ETOPO1, but its gravity information contents are those of EGM2008. Our method was validated by comparison with a direct numerical integration approach applied to a test area in Morocco-South of Spain (Kuhn, private communication 2011) and the agreement was satisfactory. Finally isostatic corrections according to the Airy model, but in spherical geometry, with harmonic coefficients derived from the sets of the ETOPO1 different parts, were computed with a uniform depth of compensation of 30 km. The new world Bouguer and isostatic gravity maps and grids here produced will be made available through the Commission for the Geological Map of the World. Since gravity values are those of the EGM2008 model, geophysical interpretation from these products should not be done for spatial scales below 5 arc minutes (half-wavelength). © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Abstract Understanding and predicting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and water fluxes) and the role of soils in carbon storage requires an accurate assess-ment of plant rooting distributions. Here, in a compre-hensive literature synthesis, we analyze rooting patterns for terrestrial biomes and compare distributions for vari-ous plant functional groups. We compiled a database of 250 root studies, subdividing suitable results into 11 bio-mes, and fitted the depth coefficient P to the data for each biome (Gale and Grigal 1987). 3 is a simple numer-ical index of rooting distribution based on the asymptotic equation Y = I -1d, where d = depth and Y = the propor-tion of roots from the surface to depth d. High values of d correspond to a greater proportion of roots with depth. Tundra, boreal forest, and temperate grasslands showed the shallowest rooting profiles (p = 0.913, 0.943, and 0.943, respectively), with 80-90\% of roots in the top 30 cm of soil; deserts and temperate coniferous forests showed the deepest profiles (j = 0.975 and 0.976, re-spectively) and had only 50\% of their roots in the upper 30 cm. Standing root biomass varied by over an order of magnitude across biomes, from approximately 0.2 to 5 kg m-2. Tropical evergreen forests had the highest root biomass (5 kg m-2), but other forest biomes and sclero-phyllous shrublands were of similar magnitude. Root biomass for croplands, deserts, tundra and grasslands was below 1.5 kg m-2. Root/shoot (R/S) ratios were highest for tundra, grasslands, and cold deserts (ranging from 4 to 7); forest ecosystems and croplands had the lowest R/S ratios (approximately 0.1 to 0.5). Comparing data across biomes for plant functional groups, grasses had 44\% of their roots in the top 10 cm of soil (,B = 0.952), while shrubs had only 21\% in the same depth increment (3 = 0.978). The rooting distribution of all temperate and tropical trees was P = 0.970 with 26\% of roots in the top 10 cm and 60\% in the top 30 cm. Overall, the globally averaged root distribution for all ecosystems was P = 0.966 (r2 = 0.89) with approximate-ly 30\%, 50\%, and 75\% of roots in the top 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm, respectively. We discuss the merits and possi-ble shortcomings of our analysis in the context of root biomass and root functioning.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Emerging infectious diseases in humans are frequently caused by pathogens originating from animal hosts, and zoonotic disease outbreaks present a major challenge to global health. To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans.},

	abstract = {Geochemical mapping of biosphere variation has wide application to geological, environmental, forensic and archaeological research. The extent to which trace elements may be used to complement strontium isotopes (87Sr/86Sr) for biosphere characterisation is unclear and uncertainties exist regarding the most suitable sample media for this purpose. Here, the variation in 87Sr/86Sr and trace elements, with focus on the rare earth elements and yttrium (REE + Y), are measured in soil leachates, vegetation and streamwaters. These independent tracers are employed to define geochemical reservoirs and quantify soil-plant-water interactions in a geologically diverse and archaeologically significant area of Ireland, County (Co.) Meath. This integrated isotope and element approach produces the first combined dataset for this temperate environment. Biological absorption coefficients (BAC) are used to assess bio-uptake of selected elements. The REE + Y exhibited greatest utility in revealing soil parameter controls on bio-uptake, such as reduced availability from preferential retention of Ce on Fe/Mn-oxyhydroxide surfaces, as well as revealing a preferential uptake of Y relative to HREE. High Y/Ho ratios (65.3–465) are exhibited in ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior L.), regardless of geological setting, indicating a potential species-specific preference. However, aerial portions of ash trees do not directly reflect the REE in the bioavailable portion of the soil, indicating selectivity from the soil reservoir or fractionation during plant uptake and/or intra-plant distribution. Streamwater REE patterns have a consistent and seawater-like pattern probably inherited from marine carbonate bedrock, surficial marine carbonate-derived till, agricultural fertiliser or a combination of all three, and thus were not site lithology diagnostic. By contrast, distinct variation in sources of 87Sr/86Sr to streamwaters is evident and reflects small-scale differences in underlying bedrock. The 87Sr/86Sr range of vegetation for the study area is 0.7081–0.7130. Soil and streamwater samples collected at proximal locations to the vegetation demonstrated a range of 0.7086–0.7133 for soil leachates and 0.7081 to 0.7107 for streamwaters. Statistically significant (p {\textless}.05) differences between the spatial distribution of 87Sr/86Sr in plants and certain underlying bedrock/Quaternary sediment were identified, even in a region without an extreme range in 87Sr/86Sr values. Careful selection of appropriate soil leaching protocols is necessary for an informative estimate of the natural ranges that exist within the pedosphere, supporting the notion that plant material is the most suitable sample medium for mapping bioavailable Sr. The high degree of spatial variability in 87Sr/86Sr and differences between reservoirs can only be accurately represented by relatively high-density sampling of plants. These data complement both national and European-wide initiatives to produce large-scale 87Sr/86Sr biosphere maps.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotopes are used in archaeology, ecology, forensics, and other disciplines to study the origin of artefacts, humans, animals and food items. Strontium in animal and human tissues such as bone and teeth originates from food and drink consumed during life, leaving an isotopic signal corresponding to their geographical origin (i.e. where the plants grew, the animals grazed and the drinking water passed through). To contextualise the measurements obtained directly on animal and human remains, it is necessary to have a sound baseline of the isotopic variation of biologically available strontium in the landscape. In general, plants represent the main source of strontium for humans and animals as they usually contain much higher strontium concentrations than animal products (meat and milk) or drinking water. The observed difference between the strontium isotope composition of geological bedrock, soils and plants from the same locality warrants direct measurement of plants to create a reliable baseline. Here we present the first baseline of the biologically available strontium isotope composition for the island of Ireland based on 228 measurements on plants from 140 distinct locations. The isoscape shows significant variation in strontium isotope composition between different areas of Ireland with values as low as 0.7067 for the basalt outcrops in County Antrim and values of up to 0.7164 in the Mourne Mountains. This variability confirms the potential for studying mobility and landscape use of past human and animal populations in Ireland. Furthermore, in some cases, large differences were observed between different types of plants from the same location, highlighting the need to measure more than one plant sample per location for the creation of BASr baselines.},

Unfortunately, budgeting the inputs and outputs of calcium in the soil-vegetation ecosystem is a very laborious task.

However, since strontium and calcium exhibit similar geochemical behaviour, it is possible to make an estimation of the calcium content in different media in the soil-vegetation eco-system using natural strontium isotopes. Preliminary analyses of water (precipitation, throughfall, runoff, soil-water), soil (mineral matter) and biological material (trees, mussel-shells) show that the use of the strontium isotope ratio 87Sr/86Sr is a powerful tool in estimating and understanding environmental changes. © 1990.},

Stratified shallow oxic groundwaters in both watersheds contained a retrievable record of increasing recharge rates of chemicals including NO3/-, Cl, Mg, Ca and Sr that were correlated with increasing fertilizer use between about 1940 and 1990. The component of Sr associated with recent agricultural recharge was relatively radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr = 0.715) and it was overwhelming with respect to Sr acquired naturally by water-rock interactions in the oxidized, non-calcareous portion of the saturated zone. Agricultural groundwaters that penetrated relatively unoxidized calcareous glauconitic sediments at depth acquired an additional component of Sr from dissolution of early tertiary marine CaCO3 (87Sr/86Sr=0.708) while undergoing O2 reduction and denitrification. Ground-water discharge contained mixtures of waters of various ages and redox states. Two streams draining the area are considered to have higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios and NO3/- concentrations than they would in the absence of agriculture; however, the streams have consistently different 87Sr/86Sr ratios and NO3/- concentrations because the average depth to calcareous reducing (denitrifying) sediments in the local groundwater flow system was different in the two watersheds. The results of this study indicate that agriculture can alter significantly the isotope geochemistry of Sr in aquifers and streams and that the effects could vary depending on the types, sources and amounts of fertilizers added, the history of fertilizer use and groundwater residence times.

However, the systematics and mechanisms controlling spatial variation in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of modern human hair remain unclear. Here, we measure 87 Sr/ 86 Sr of hair specimens from across the USA to assess the presence of geospatial relationships. Methods: Ninety-eight human hair specimens were collected from salon/barbershop floors in 48 municipalities throughout the conterminous USA. [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios were measured from hair using quadrupole and multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers, respectively. The [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of hair were compared with the measured [Sr] and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of tap waters from the collection locations. In addition, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of hair was compared with the modeled ratios of bedrock and surface waters. Results: Hair color was independent of the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio, but related to [Sr]. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of hair and leachate were not statistically different and were positively correlated; however, in several hair-leachate pairs, the ratios were conspicuously different. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of both hair and leachate were linearly correlated with tap water. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of hair was also significantly correlated with the modeled ratio of bedrock and surface waters, although the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of hair was most strongly correlated with the measured ratio of tap water. Conclusions: The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio of hair is related to the ratio of tap water, which varied geographically. The ratio of hair provided geographic information about an individual's recent residence. Differences in the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of hair and hair leachate may be concomitant with travel and could potentially be used as a screening tool to identify recent movements.},

	abstract = {The two main sources of Ca in forest ecosystems are mineral weathering release and atmospheric inputs. We use the 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratio (Sr is used as a proxy for Ca) to determine the Ca contribution from atmospheric deposition input in two forest ecosystems (beech stands) growing on soils formed from parent materials with contrasting total Ca contents and isotopic ratios: Pleistocene loess in Central Belgium (acid leached soil) and Lower Devonian shales in the Ardenne Massif of High Belgium (ochreous brown earth). The 87Sr/86Sr ratio and the Ca and Sr contents were measured in bulk precipitation, in vegetation (beechwood growth rings and leaves) and in main soil horizons (total, acid-extractable and labile pools). The relative contributions of atmospheric input and soil mineral weathering to vegetation were calculated using mixing equations. Calculations based on Sr isotope ratios of bulk precipitation (end-member 1; 87Sr/ 86Sr close to ocean water: 0.7090), 0.1 M HCl-extractable soil fraction (end-member 2) and beech wood (mixing compartment) indicate that about 43\% (Central Belgium) and 39\% (Ardennes) of Sr uptake originates from atmospheric inputs. For Ca, the contributions of atmospheric input are 75\% and 78\%, respectively. These estimations are, however, very sensitive to the choice of the appropriate 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ca ratios for the weathering end-member. The isotopic composition of the mineral source is estimated from the soil mineralogical composition and the relative weatherability of the Sr-bearing minerals. Due to soil processes (mineral weathering, element recycling) and geomorphological events (addition of allochtonous minerals to the autochtonous pool inherited from the local bedrock), the distribution of minerals in both soil profiles is heterogeneous and varies from horizon to horizon. Which horizons are relevant and which soil pool (total soil, acid-extractable fraction or labile pool) should be selected for isotopic measurement of the weathering end-member, is therefore open to uncertainty. The choice of the appropriate 87Sr/86Sr and Sr/Ca ratios for the weathering end-member is discussed. Our results emphasize the importance of the atmospheric contribution of Ca for tree mineral nutrition in the studied forest stands, suggesting that these ecosystems on acid soils are sensitive to chemical changes in the atmospheric environment, e.g. acid depositions associated with decreasing input of atmospheric cations. Our results support therefore the conclusion of Hedin et al. [Hedin, L.O., Granat, L., Likens, G.E., Bulshand, T.A., Galloway, J.N., Butler, T., Rodhe, H., 1994. Steep declines in atmospheric base cations in regions of Europe and North America. Nature, 367: 351-354], suggesting that the atmospheric base cation trends in Europe and North America are ecologically relevant on the scale of decades for poorly buffered ecosystems. This is a serious possibility of depletion of the soil available cation pool of the High Belgium beech forest, which grows on a bedrock with extremely low levels of total calcium. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

School closure (also called class dismissal in North America) is a non-pharmaceutical intervention that is commonly suggested for mitigating influenza pandemics. Health officials taking the decision to close schools must weigh the potential health benefits of reducing transmission and thus case numbers against high economic and social costs, difficult ethical issues, and the possible disruption of key services such as health care. Also, if schools are expected to close as a deliberate policy option, or just because of high levels of staff absenteeism, it is important to plan to mitigate the negative features of closure. In this context, there is still debate about if, when, and how school closure policy should be used. In this Review, we take a multidisciplinary and holistic perspective and review the multiple aspects of school closure as a public health policy.

Here we conduct a crosscontinental, cross-scale (almost five orders of magnitude) analysis of the influence of biotic and abiotic processes and human population density on the distribution of three emerging pathogens: the amphibian chytrid fungus implicated in worldwide amphibian declines and West Nile virus and the bacterium that causes Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), which are responsible for ongoing human health crises. In all three systems, we show that biotic factors were significant predictors of pathogen distributions in multiple regression models only at local scales (∼102-103 km2), whereas climate and human population density always were significant only at relatively larger, regional scales (usually {\textgreater}104 km2). Spatial autocorrelation analyses revealed that biotic factors were more variable at smaller scales, whereas climatic factors were more variable at larger scales, as is consistent with the prediction that factors should be important at the scales at which they vary the most. Finally, no single scale could detect the importance of all three categories of processes. These results highlight that common single-scale analyses can misrepresent the true impact of anthropogenic modifications on biodiversity and the environment.},

	doi = {10.1101/2020.02.28.960195},
	abstract = {Knowledge on long-distance migration of insects is especially important for food security, public health, and conservation–issues that are especially significant in Africa. During the wet season, the Sahel nourishes diverse life forms which are soon purged by the long dry season. Windborne migration is a key strategy enabling exploitation of such ephemeral havens. However, our knowledge of these large-scale movements remains sparse due to the virtual invisibility of insects flying at altitude. In this first cross-season investigation (3 years) of the aerial insect fauna over Africa, we sampled crepuscular and nocturnal insects flying 40–290 m above ground in four Sahelian villages in Mali, using sticky nets mounted on tethered helium-filled balloons. Nearly half a million insects were caught, representing at least thirteen insect orders following preliminary sorting of the collections. At least 100 insect families were determined to have been captured at altitude in samples collected on 222 nets, obtained in 125 collections over 96 nights. Control nets (raised momentarily to {\textgreater}40 m during system launch and retrieval) confirmed that the insects were captured at altitude, not near the ground. Thirteen ecologically and phylogenetically diverse species were studied in detail. The flight activity of all species peaked during the wet season every year across localities up to {\textasciitilde}100 km apart, and occurred over multiple nights, suggesting regular migrations. Species differed in flight altitude, seasonality, and correlations with aerial temperatures, humidity, and wind speed. All taxa exhibited frequent migrations on southerly winds, accounting for the recolonization of the Sahel from southern source populations. “Return” southward movement at the end of the wet season occurred in most taxa but no selectivity for such winds was detected. Extrapolation of aerial density to estimate the seasonal number of migrants crossing Mali at latitude 14°N suggested numbers in the trillions, even for the modestly abundant taxa. Assuming 2–10 hours of flight, the nightly distances traversed exceed tens and even hundreds of kilometers. Two migration strategies were proposed: “residential Sahelian migration” and “round trip migration”. The unprecedented magnitude and diversity of long-range windborne insect migrations highlight the importance of this life strategy in their impact on Sahelian and neighboring ecosystems.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After one generation of exposure, we tested for changes in key morphological, behavioural and physiological traits related to migratory performance, including wing dimorphism, flight capacity and positive phototaxis. Our results showed that all three morphological and behavioural phenotypes responded to a small difference in magnetic field intensity. Consistent magnetic responses in the expression of the phototaxis-related Drosophila-like cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) gene and levels of two primary energy substrates used during flight, triglyceride and trehalose, were also found. Our findings indicate changes in GMF intensity can alter the expression of phenotypes critical for insect migration and highlight the unique role of magnetoreception as a trait that may help migratory insects express potentially beneficial phenotypes in geographically variable environments.},

This total conflicts with the results of several recent pierid DNA barcode studies across the Neotropics. We used a five-locus dataset to carry out species delimitation analyses using the coalescence-based method implemented in bpp software. After testing the resulting species hypotheses using marginal likelihood estimates, we inferred their phylogenetic relationships and performed an ancestral range reconstruction with biogeobears. Our analyses recovered two different hypotheses, 26 and 24 species, that scored the highest marginal likelihood estimate. Differences between these two hypotheses, when reconciled with barcode clusters and morphology, indicated that 24 is the most likely number of species. Phoebis neocypris stat. rev., Phoebis rurina stat. rev., Phoebis virgo stat. rev., Phoebis marcellina stat. rev., Phoebis thalestris stat. rev., and Phoebis rorata stat. rev. are raised to the species rank. We dated the crown age of Phoebis to the mid-Miocene, with the islands of the Greater Antilles as the most probable ancestral range. Three main clades of Phoebis diverged early in the evolutionary history of the genus, but most extant species-level diversity arose after the Pliocene–Pleistocene boundary. Our analyses recovered alternate range expansions and contractions, and dispersal from the islands to the continent and back, in the three main clades.

	abstract = {The eastern North American monarch butterfly population shows a long-term population decline. While it is hypothesized that forest loss on the wintering grounds and milkweed loss throughout the breeding range are responsible for the observed decline, there is much less certainty regarding the factors driving year-to-year variation around the current population level. Using 15 years of butterfly count data, we used a community-based approach to delineate the stage of the annual cycle during which population limiting factors are most strongly acting. We compared annual fluctuations in size of the breeding population of monarch butterflies in Canada to fluctuations in 13 additional butterfly species which either migrate long distances to Canada or are resident but breed in similar habitats to the monarch. We show that the breeding population of monarchs in southern Canada shows a higher degree of synchrony with other long-distance migrants than with breeding residents, and that annual fluctuations of all migrant butterflies show a positive correlation with the number of 21◦ C days during spring migration and re-colonization. Further, we found that size of the monarch breeding population shows a higher degree of synchrony with the size of the following winter population than with the size of the previous winter population. Combined, our results suggest that the monarch population in Canada is limited by factors acting during spring migration, and that weather plays an important role in the ability of the monarch to successfully re-colonize and breed in the northern portion of their summer range each year. A predicted increase in temperature in the early spring, combined with continued loss of breeding and wintering habitat, has the potential to limit the reproductive capacity of monarchs and their ability to recover from population lows.},

	abstract = {The formation of social groups has important impacts on fitness for many animal species, with differences in group compositions resulting in a range of fitness outcomes for individuals. Recent interest in mixed-species grouping, which extends from a large body of literature invested in understanding single-species grouping, highlights novel complexities of group formation which relate to phenotypic, behavioural and physiological differences that naturally exist between species. Among fishes, mixed-species shoaling is a common form of social grouping behaviour displayed across a range of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Research explaining mixed-species shoaling shows some overlap with explanations for single-species shoaling; however, it also demonstrates that distinct differences between species give rise to unique cost-benefit trade-offs which need to be incorporated into conceptual models of mixed-species shoaling behaviour. Unique predation related trade-offs may arise from inefficiency of the confusion effect, variation in vigilance between species and unequal species-preferences shown by predators, whilst unique foraging-related trade-offs may arise from diet partitioning, variations in foraging behaviour and differences in competitive abilities between species. We review the literature on fitness outcomes associated with mixed-species shoaling and present a new theoretical framework to explain the cost-benefit trade-offs for individuals within mixed-species shoals. The framework incorporates both trade-offs arising from differences between species and those arising from group size, the former having been largely ignored due to a focus on single-species shoaling. Our framework is designed to inform future research striving to explain mixed-species shoaling behaviour.},

Using light microscopy, we documented the presence of haemoparasites in over 2000 individuals belonging to 246 species of wild birds, from nine localities and several ecosystems of Colombia. We analysed the prevalence of six avian haemoparasite taxa in relation to elevation and the following host traits: nest height, nest type, foraging strata, primary diet, sociality, migratory behaviour, and participation in mixed species flocks. Our analyses indicate significant associations between both mixed species flocks and nest height and Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon prevalence. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon increased with elevation, whereas the prevalence of Trypanosoma and microfilariae decreased. Plasmodium and Haemoproteus prevalence did not vary significantly with elevation; in fact, both parasites were found up to 3300m above sea level. The distribution of parasite prevalence across the phylogeny of bird species included in this study showed little host phylogenetic signal indicating that infection rates in this system are evolutionarily labile.

A crucial element in understanding disease dynamics, therefore, is the 'transmission term' describing the rate at which susceptible hosts are 'coverted' into infected hosts by their contact with infectious material. Recently, the conventional form of this term has been increasingly questioned, and new terminologies and conventions have been proposed. Here, therefore, we review the derivation of transmission terms, explain the basis of confusion, and provide clarification. The root of the problem has been a failure to include explicit consideration of the area occupied by a host population, alongside both the number of infectious hosts and their density within the population. We argue that the terms 'density-dependent transmission' and 'frequency-dependent transmission' remain valid and useful (though a 'fuller' transmission term for the former is identified), but that the terms 'mass action' 'true mass action' and 'pseudo mass action' are all unhelpful and should be dropped. Also, contrary to what has often been assumed, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixing in a host population is orthogonal to the distinction between density- and frequency-dependent transmission modes.},

In many viral (HIV and influenza), bacterial (TB) and prion (BSE and CWD) systems, disease-induced mortality occurs long after the host becomes infectious. Therefore, we constructed a model with two infected classes that differ in transmission rate and virulence in order to understand how the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) depends on the relative difference in transmission and virulence between classes, on the transition rate between classes and on the recovery rate from the second class. We find that ESS virulence decreases when expressed early in the infection or when transmission occurs late in an infection. When virulence occurred relatively equally in each class and there was disease recovery, ESS virulence increased with increased transition rate. In contrast, ESS virulence first increased and then decreased with transition rate when there was little virulence early in the infection and a rapid recovery rate. This model predicts that ESS virulence is highly dependent on the timing of transmission and pathology after infection; thus, pathogen evolution may either increase or decrease virulence after emergence in a new host. © 2010 The Royal Society.},

	abstract = {Phenological changes in response to climatic warming have been detected across a wide range of organisms. Butterflies stand out as one of the most popular groups of indicators of climatic change, given that, firstly, they are poikilothermic and, secondly, have been the subject of thorough monitoring programmes in several countries for a number of decades. Here we provide for the first time strong evidence of phenological change as a consequence of recent climatic warming in butterflies at a Spanish site in the northwest Mediterranean Basin. By means of the widely used Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methodology, three different phenological parameters were analysed for the most common species to test for trends over time and relationships with temperature and precipitation. Between 1988 and 2002, there was a tendency for earlier first appearance dates in all 17 butterfly species tested, and significant advances in mean flight dates in 8 out of 19 species. On the other hand, the shape of the curve of adult emergence did not show any regular pattern. These changes paralleled an increase of 1-1.5°C in mean February, March and June temperatures. Likewise, a correlation analysis indicated the strong negative effect of spring temperature on phenological parameters (i.e. higher temperatures tended to produce phenological advances), and the opposite effect of precipitation in certain months. In addition, there was some evidence to indicate that phenological responses may differ between taxonomic lineages or species with similar diets. We discuss the consequences that these changes may have on species' population abundances, especially given the expected increase in aridity in the Mediterranean Basin caused by current climatic warming. We predict that varying degrees of phenological flexibility may account for differences in species' responses and, for multivoltine species, predict strong selection favouring local seasonal adaptations such as diapause phenomena or migratory behaviour.},

Generally, species richness is positively associated with temperature, and negatively associated with habitat degradation. While these models have been well tested across spatial scales, they have rarely been tested on a temporal scale - in part due to the difficulty in ascertaining accurate historical data at an appropriate resolution. In this study, we compared the results of temporal and spatial models, each incorporating two predictors of species richness: temperature, and human population density (as a surrogate of human-related habitat impacts). We found that the change in species richness from the early to late part of the 20th century was positively correlated with temperature change, and negatively correlated with human population density change. When we compared these results to two spatial models using contemporary and historic data, the spatial effects of temperature on butterfly richness were similar to its temporal effects, while the effect of human population density through time is the opposite of its spatial effect. More generally, the assumption that spatial patterns are equivalent to temporal ones when applying macroecological data to global change is clearly unreliable. © Ecography.},

Predicting how species will respond to anticipated changes is a necessary prerequisite to effectively conserving them and reducing extinction rates. Species niche models are widely used for such predictions, but their reliability over long time periods is known to vary. However, climate and land use changes in northern countries provide a pseudo-experiment to test model reliability for predicting future conditions, provided historical data on both species distributions and environmental conditions are available. Using maximum entropy, a prominent modeling technique, we constructed historical models of butterfly species' ranges across Canada and then ran the models forward to present-day to test how well they predicted the current ranges of species. For the majority of species, projections of how we predicted species would respond to known climate changes corresponded with species' observed responses (mean autoregressive R2 = 0.70). This correspondence declined for northerly and very widely distributed species. Our results demonstrate that at least some species are tracking shifting climatic conditions across very large geographic areas and that these shifts can be predicted accurately using niche models. We also found, however, that models for some species fail when projected through time despite high spatial model accuracies during model training, highlighting the need to base management decisions on species assemblages, not individual species. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

	abstract = {Migratory animals are simultaneously challenged by the physiological demands of long-distance movements and the need to avoid natural enemies including parasites and pathogens. The potential for animal migrations to disperse pathogens across large geographic areas has prompted a growing body of research investigating the interactions between migration and infection. However, the phenomenon of animal migration is yet to be incorporated into broader theories in disease ecology. Because migrations may expose animals to a greater number and diversity of pathogens, increase contact rates between hosts, and render them more susceptible to infection via changes to immune function, migration has the potential to generate both "superspreader species" and infection "hotspots". However, migration has also been shown to reduce transmission in some species, by facilitating parasite avoidance ("migratory escape") and weeding out infected individuals ("migratory culling"). This symposium was convened in an effort to characterize more broadly the role that animal migrations play in the dynamics of infectious disease, by integrating a range of approaches and scales across host taxa. We began with questions related to within-host processes, focusing on the consequences of nutritional constraints and strenuous movement for individual immune capability, and of parasite infection for movement capacity. We then scaled-up to between-host processes to identify what types, distances, or patterns of host movements are associated with the spread of infectious agents. Finally, we discussed landscape-scale relationships between migration and infectious disease, and how these may be altered as a result of anthropogenic changes to climate and land use. We are just beginning to scratch the surface of the interactions between infection and animal migrations; yet, with so many migrations now under threat, there is an urgent need to develop a holistic understanding of the potential for migrations to both increase and reduce infection risk.},

	abstract = {During summer, a grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) (USA) can excavate and consume millions of army cutworm moths (Euxoa auxiliaris) (ACMs) that aggregate in high elevation talus. Grizzly bears in the GYE were listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1975 and were proposed for delisting in 2005. However, questions remain about key bear foods. For example, ACMs are agricultural pests and concern exists about whether they contain pesticides that could be toxic to bears. Consequently, we investigated whether ACMs contain and transport pesticides to bear foraging sites and, if so, whether these levels could be toxic to bears. In 1999 we collected and analyzed ACMs from six bear foraging sites. ACMs were screened for 32 pesticides with gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). Because gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) can be more sensitive than GC-ECD for certain pesticides, we revisited one site in 2001 and analyzed these ACMs with GC-MS/MS. ACMs contained trace or undetectable levels of pesticides in 1999 and 2001, respectively. Based on chemical levels in ACMs and numbers of ACMs a bear can consume, we calculated the potential of chemicals to reach physiological toxicity. These calculations indicate bears do not consume physiologically toxic levels of pesticides and allay concerns they are at risk from pesticides transported by ACMs. If chemical control of ACMs changes in the future, screening new ACM samples taken from bear foraging sites may be warranted. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As background context for our examination, we considered topics such as ecological sampling (probability based, purposive, opportunistic), linkage between sampling technique and statistical inference (design based, model based), and scientific paradigms (confirmatory, exploratory). We distinguished several types of citizen science investigations, from intensive research with rigorous protocols targeting clearly articulated questions to mass-participation internet-based projects with opportunistic data collection lacking sampling design, and examined overarching objectives, design, analysis, volunteer training, and performance. We identified key features that influence data quality: project objectives, design and analysis, and volunteer training and performance. Projects with good designs, trained volunteers, and professional oversight can meet statistical criteria to produce high-quality data with strong inferential power and therefore are well suited for ecological research objectives. Projects with opportunistic data collection, little or no sampling design, and minimal volunteer training are better suited for general objectives related to public education or data exploration because reliable statistical estimation can be difficult or impossible. In some cases, statistically robust analytical methods, external data, or both may increase the inferential power of certain opportunistically collected data. Ecological management, especially by government agencies, frequently requires data suitable for reliable inference. With standardized protocols, state-of-the-art analytical methods, and well-supervised programs, citizen science can make valuable contributions to conservation by increasing the scope of species monitoring efforts. Data quality can be improved by adhering to basic principles of data collection and analysis, designing studies to provide the data quality required, and including suitable statistical expertise, thereby strengthening the science aspect of citizen science and enhancing acceptance by the scientific community and decision makers.},

	abstract = {87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios in skeletal remains of archaeological vertebrates are used for provenance analysis since long. However, the definition of the past bioavailable isotopic ratio at the site of recovery is not known beforehand and geological maps can provide no more than gross expectations. Therefore, the assessment of the “local Sr isotopic signature” is still of crucial importance. In this study, we present a tool for the prediction of such local isotopic signatures by creating a concentration weighted mixing model that links lithospheric, biospheric, and atmospheric strontium per site. The major strontium sources and their input into an animal's body were assessed by choosing elemental strontium and its isotopic signature in groundwater, soil, vegetation, and precipitation as components for the mixing model, augmented by literature values. The model was applied to 24 sites located in the alpine transect of the Inn-Eisack-Adige-Brenner passage across the European Alps, a passage used since the Mesolithic. Predicted local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios were compared with measured values from locally excavated archaeozoological bone samples from three taxa of large and mainly residential vertebrates (cattle, pig, red deer) to verify the models’ accuracy. With regard to the fact that the environmental samples predict the past local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr at a specific site while the vertebrates had different and species-specific home ranges, thereby integrating strontium from a region of primarily unknown size, the model is capable of assigning reasonable expectation values. For 11 sites, up to 100\% of the vertebrate isotopic signatures were correctly predicted. Mismatches at the remaining sites are explainable by special environmental factors, and also the fact that some import of animals can never be excluded beforehand. Suggestions for site-specific adjustments of the model are made.},

	abstract = {A basic question concerning the monarch butterflies' fall migration is which monarchs succeed in reaching overwintering sites in Mexico, which fail—and why. We document the timing and pace of the fall migration, ask whether the sun's position in the sky is associated with the pace of the migration, and ask whether timing affects success in completing the migration. Using data from the Monarch Watch tagging program, we explore whether the fall monarch migration is associated with the daily maximum vertical angle of the sun above the horizon (Sun Angle at Solar Noon, SASN) or whether other processes are more likely to explain the pace of the migration. From 1998 to 2015, more than 1.38 million monarchs were tagged and 13,824 (1\%) were recovered in Mexico. The pace of migration was relatively slow early in the migration but increased in late September and declined again later in October as the migrating monarchs approached lower latitudes. This slow-fast-slow pacing in the fall migration is consistent with monarchs reaching latitudes with the same SASN, day after day, as they move south to their overwintering sites. The observed pacing pattern and overall movement rates are also consistent with monarchs migrating at a pace determined by interactions among SASN, temperature, and daylength. The results suggest monarchs successfully reaching the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve (MBBR) migrate within a “migration window” with an SASN of about 57° at the leading edge of the migration and 46° at the trailing edge. Ninety percent of the tags recovered in Mexico were from monarchs tagged within this window. Migrants reaching locations along the migration route with SASN outside this migration window may be considered early or late migrants. We noted several years with low overwintering abundance of monarchs, 2004 and 2011–2014, with high percentages of late migrants. This observation suggests a possible effect of migration timing on population size. The migration window defined by SASN can serve as a framework against which to establish the influence of environmental factors on the size, geographic distribution, and timing of past and future fall migrations.},

Bogong moths constitute a keystone species in the ecology of the alpine zone of mainland Australia. Although known to transport nutrients and energy essential to the functioning of the alpine ecosystem, this has never been quantified. By allocating mortality between predation, and non-predator-related causes, a model was constructed to calculate mortality of moths in the Snowy Mountains region of the Australian Alps. Density of predators, their food requirements and the proportion of predator diet that was moth were estimated, and energy and nutrient content of moths were measured. This allowed a first order estimate of the total mortality of moths above 1500m in the Snowy Mountains annually (1015 million) and the annual contributions of energy (4929GJ) and nutrients (7.2t of nitrogen and 0.97t of phosphorus) by these moths to the system.

However, the contributions by pollinators other than bees have been little explored despite their potential to contribute to crop production and stability in the face of environmental change. Non-bee pollinators include flies, beetles, moths, butterflies, wasps, ants, birds, and bats, among others. Here we focus on non-bee insects and synthesize 39 field studies from five continents that directly measured the crop pollination services provided by non-bees, honey bees, and other bees to compare the relative contributions of these taxa. Non-bees performed 25-50\% of the total number of flower visits. Although non-bees were less effective pollinators than bees per flower visit, they made more visits; thus these two factors compensated for each other, resulting in pollination services rendered by non-bees that were similar to those provided by bees. In the subset of studies that measured fruit set, fruit set increased with non-bee insect visits independently of bee visitation rates, indicating that non-bee insects provide a unique benefit that is not provided by bees. We also show that non-bee insects are not as reliant as bees on the presence of remnant natural or seminatural habitat in the surrounding landscape. These results strongly suggest that non-bee insect pollinators play a significant role in global crop production and respond differently than bees to landscape structure, probably making their crop pollination services more robust to changes in land use. Non-bee insects provide a valuable service and provide potential insurance against bee population declines.},

We present 87Sr/86Sr ratios of soil carbonate, parent rock, dry river course silts, floodplain, playa, dust and rain samples, as well as δ18O and δ13C values of selected samples. Results show that both parent rock and dust are important sources of cations for soil carbonate in this inland setting where bedrock is dominated by silicate lithologies. Dust in southeast Arizona has higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7100-0.7123) than Phanerozoic sea water (0.7070-0.7096). These high ratios derive ultimately from silicate rocks. Our δ18O and δ13C data show clearly that the dominant source of carbonate dust is eroded older soil carbonate, not bedrock limestone. Because dust contributes significantly to newly-forming soil carbonate, some products of silicate weathering may reside in soil carbonate two or more times before being removed from the region, and this recycling retards the rate at which the products of silicate weathering enter the sedimentary system. Comparison of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of carbonate dust from southeast Arizona with those from surrounding regions shows that dust 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and by inference carbonate dust sources, vary on a scale of 200-300 km in the southwest United States.

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods: We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk. Results: The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions: By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

We relate feedback theory, which focuses on pathogen-mediated coexistence, to mechanisms of dilution derived from epidemiological models, with the central goal of gaining insights into host-pathogen interactions in a community context. We first compare the origin, structure, and application of epidemiological and feedback models. We then explore the mechanisms of dilution, which are grounded in single-pathogen, single-host epidemiological models, from the perspective of feedback theory. We also draw on feedback theory to examine how coinfecting pathogens, and pathogens that vary along a host specialist-generalist continuum, apply to dilution theory. By identifying synergies among the feedback and epidemiological approaches, we reveal ways in which organisms occupying different trophic levels contribute to diversity-disease relationships. Additionally, using feedbacks to distinguish dilution in disease incidence from dilution in the net effect of disease on host fitness allows us to articulate conditions under which definitions of dilution may not align. After ascribing dilution mechanisms to macro-or microorganisms, we propose ways in which each contributes to diversity-disease and productivity-diversity relationships. Our analyses lead to predictions that can guide future research efforts.},

Because fall armyworm does not survive prolonged freezing, the infestations annually affecting most ofNorth America aremigrants fromsouthern Texas and Florida,where winter temperatures are mild and host plants are available. A haplotype method was developed that can distinguish between these two geographically distant overwintering populations, with the potential to delineate the associated migratory pathways. Several years of collections from major corn-producing areas in the southern, central, and eastern United States were used to map the geographical distribution of the fall armyworm haplotypes. From these haplotype profiles, it was possible to develop the most detailed description yet of the annual northward movements of fall armyworm. The consistency of these results with past studies and the implications on our understanding of fall armyworm biology are discussed. A better understanding of fall armyworm populations and their movement is critical for the development of strategies to predict infestation levels and eventually control this pest in the United States. © 2012 The Authors.},

Many insect populations, including butterflies, moths, hoverflies, and dragonflies, make repeated seasonal migrations each year. It is only during the past century that biologists have come to accept the concept of insect migration, and new research using radar, citizen science, and stable isotopes has revealed unexpected insights about this phenomenon. Drawing on these findings, we demonstrate how seasonal insect movements are both massive and ecologically influential, with consequences for food webs, nutrient transport, pollination, and infectious disease. Responding to environmental changes, some mobile insect populations are declining or shifting the timing and extent of their journeys. We suggest research and policy priorities for investigating and protecting insect migrations. Outcomes from such work could transform strategies for agricultural pest control and wildlife conservation, and could help preserve the ecological functions performed by migratory insects.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) are a popular tool in provenance applications in archeology, forensics, paleoecology, and environmental sciences. Using bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr in provenance studies requires comparing the 87Sr/86Sr of a sample of interest to that of 87Sr/86Sr baselines. Historically, these baselines required building empirical datasets from plants or local animals to characterize the 87Sr/86Sr available to local ecosystems (bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr). However, researchers are increasingly relying on modeled bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr maps (called isoscapes). We review the advantages and limitations of existing approaches to mapping bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr for provenance studies and propose a globally applicable, scalable, and editable framework for creating bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes. This framework relies on: 1) Compiling global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; 2) Mapping 87Sr/86Sr variability in rocks; 3) Leveraging global environmental covariates; and 4) Applying a random forest regression method that integrates these data to predict bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr. When the random-forest model is applied at the global scale it performs well (explaining 60\% of the variance of the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr dataset), and accounts for geological, geomorphological and atmospheric controls. In data-rich regions (e.g., Europe), the global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscape can be successfully extrapolated to broad regions without bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data. However, we also show that this extrapolation may not be valid in exceptionally geologically complex and data-poor regions (e.g., Madagascar). We suggest research directions to improve the accuracy of global bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes, which include: 1) Increasing the collection of bioavailable datasets in data-poor regions; 2) Harmonizing data management practices and metadata collection for bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data; and 3) Relying on advances in remote sensing and geological mapping techniques to improve geological covariates. While significant potential to refine 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes remains, the data products provided in this review form a basis for using 87Sr/86Sr data in large-scale provenance studies, opening new research avenues in a range of fields.},

	abstract = {Of the four most diverse insect orders, Lepidoptera contains remarkably few predatory and parasitic species. Although species with these habits have evolved multiple times in moths and butterflies, they have rarely been associated with diversification. The wholly aphytophagous subfamily Miletinae (Lycaenidae) is an exception, consisting of nearly 190 species distributed primarily throughout the Old World tropics and subtropics. Most miletines eat Hemiptera, although some consume ant brood or are fed by ant trophallaxis. A well-resolved phylogeny inferred using 4915 bp from seven markers sampled from representatives of all genera and nearly one-third the described species was used to examine the biogeography and evolution of biotic associations in this group. Biogeographic analyses indicate that Miletinae likely diverged from an African ancestor near the start of the Eocene, and four lineages dispersed between Africa and Asia. Phylogenetic constraint in prey selection is apparent at two levels: related miletine species are more likely to feed on related Hemiptera, and related miletines are more likely to associate with related ants, either directly by eating the ants, or indirectly by eating hemipteran prey that are attended by those ants. These results suggest that adaptations for host ant location by ovipositing female miletines may have been retained from phytophagous ancestors that associated with ants mutualistically},

For example, quantitative tools for comparing multiple probability-of-origin maps do not exist, and many existing approaches for geographic assignment of individuals have not been validated or compared with respect to precision and accuracy. To address these challenges, we created and analyzed probability-of-origin maps using stable hydrogen isotope values from known-origin individuals of three species of migratory bat. We used a metric of spatial overlap to group individuals by areas of origin without a priori knowledge of such regions. The metric of spatial similarity allowed for quantitative comparison of geographic origins and grouping of individuals with similar origins. We then compared four approaches for inferring origins (cumulative-sum, odds-ratio, quantile-only, and quantile-simulation) across a range of thresholds and probable minimum distance traveled. The accuracy of geographic origins and minimum distance traveled varied across species at most threshold values for most approaches. The cumulative-sum and quantile-simulation approaches had generally higher precision at a given level of accuracy than the odds-ratio and quantile-only approaches, and many threshold values were associated with a relatively high degree ({\textgreater} 300 km) of variation in minimum distance traveled. Overall, these results reinforce the importance of validating assignment techniques with known-origin individuals when possible.

We demonstrate the potential of extracting high-resolution dietary information from stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) in horse tail-hair, in response to short-term changes in diet in controlled feeding experiments. 2. Tail hairs were sampled from six horses that had been equilibrated to C3 forage and were then subjected to a series of short-term diet switches to the C4 Coastal Bermuda Grass (Cynodon dactylon L.). Four of these horses were equilibrated to Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and were then subjected to 1-, 3- and 7-day diet spikes of the C4 grass. The remaining two horses were equilibrated to a C3 grass mix (Dactylis glomerata L. and Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and then subjected to a 7-day diet spike of C4 grass. 3. The effects of the short-term diet switches were easily observable in the hair. The 1-, 3- and 7-day spikes showed an increasing deviation from the prespike equilibrium value of 1.0‰, 2.9‰ and 5.6‰ (7-day treatments averaged). 4. Isotopic chronologies of individual hairs were created and plotted against a three-pool, exponential-decay model. With small alterations to the original model parameters, our data are well explained by this model. 5. This study indicates that information about diet is recorded with high resolution in hair. This method could be applied to both modern and ancient samples, greatly enhancing the temporal resolution of diet reconstruction studies.},

	doi = {10.1098/rstb.1999.0360},
	abstract = {Fundamental to the understanding of human history is the ability to make interpretations based on artefacts and other remains which are used to gather information about an ancient population. Sequestered in the organic matrices of these remains can be information, for example, concerning incidence of disease, genetic defects and diet. Stable isotopic compositions, especially those made on isolates of collagen from bones, have been used to help suggest principal dietary components. A significant problem in the use of collagen is its long-term stability, and the possibility of isotopic alteration during early diagenesis, or through contaminating condensation reactions. In this study, we suggest that a commonly overlooked material, human hair, may represent an ideal material to be used in addressing human diets of ancient civilizations. Through the analysis of the amino-acid composition of modern hair, as well as samples that were subjected to radiation (thus simulating ageing of the hair) and hair from humans that is up to 5200 years old, we have observed little in the way of chemical change. The principal amino acids observed in all of these samples are essentially identical in relative abundances and content. Dominating the compositions are serine, glutamic acid, threonine, glycine and leucine, respectively accounting for approximately 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 8\% and 8\% of the total hydrolysable amino acids. Even minor components (for example, alanine, valine, isoleucine) show similar constancy between the samples of different ages. This constancy clearly indicates minimal alteration of the amino-acid composition of the hair. Further, it would indicate that hair is well preserved and is amenable to isotopic analysis as a tool for distinguishing sources of nutrition. Based on this observation, we have isotopically characterized modern individuals for whom the diet has been documented. Both stable nitrogen and carbon isotope compositions were assessed, and together provide an indication of trophic status, and principal type (C3 or C4) of vegetation consumed. True vegans have nitrogen isotope compositions of about 7‰ whereas humans consuming larger amounts of meat, eggs, or milk are more enriched in the heavy nitrogen isotope. We have also analysed large cross-sections of modern humans from North America and Europe to provide an indication of the variability seen in a population (the supermarket diet). There is a wide diversity in both carbon and nitrogen isotope values based at least partially on the levels of seafood, corn-fed beef and grains in the diets. Following analysis of the ancient hair, we have observed similar trends in certain ancient populations. For example, the Coptics of Egypt (1000 BP) and Chinchorro of Chile (5000-800 BP) have diets of similar diversity to those observed in the modern group but were isotopically influenced by local nutritional sources. In other ancient hair (Egyptian Late Middle Kingdom mummies, ca. 4000 BP), we have observed a much more uniform isotopic signature, indicating a more constant diet. We have also recognized a primary vegetarian component in the diet of the Neolithic Ice Man of the Oetztaler Alps (5200 BP). In certain cases, it appears that sulphur isotopes may help to further constrain dietary interpretations, owing to the good preservation and sulphur content of hair. It appears that analysis of the often-overlooked hair in archaeological sites may represent a significant new approach for understanding ancient human communities.},

Broad, systematic, geospatial variation in stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes of environmental water and the capacity for rapid, precise measurement via methods such as high-temperature conversion elemental analyzer/isotope ratio mass spectrometry (TC/EA-IRMS) make these isotope systems particularly well suited for applications requiring the geolocation of hair samples. In order for such applications to be successful, however, methods must exist for the accurate determination of hair δ2H and δ18O values reflecting the primary products of biosynthesis. Here, we present the results of experiments designed to examine two potential inaccuracies affecting δ2H and δ18O measurements of hair: the contribution of non-biologic hydrogen and oxygen to samples in the form of sorbed molecular water, and the exchange of hydroxyl-bound hydrogen between hair keratin and ambient water vapor. We show that rapid sorption of molecular water from the atmosphere can have a substantial effect on measured δ2H and δ18O values of hair (comprising ∼7.7\% of the measured isotopic signal for H and up to ∼10.6\% for O), but that this contribution can be effectively removed through vacuum-drying of samples for 6 days. Hydrogen exchange between hair keratin and ambient vapor is also rapid (reaching equilibrium within 3-4 days), with 9-16\% of the total hydrogen available for exchange at room temperature. Based on the results of these experiments, we outline a recommended sample treatment procedure for routine measurement of δ2H and δ18O in mammal hair. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Determination of non-exchangeable hydrogen isotopic compositions (δ2H values) of bulk complex organic materials is difficult due to uncontrolled H isotope exchange between the organic material and ambient water vapor. A number of calibration keratinous materials with carefully measured hydrogen isotopic compositions of the non-exchangeable fraction were proposed to enable stable isotope laboratories to normalize their 2H measurements. However, it was recently reported that high-temperature carbon-reactor methods for measuring the hydrogen isotopic composition of nitrogenous organic materials is biased by the production of HCN in the reactor. As a result, the reported values of these calibration materials needed to be re-evaluated. Methods: We evaluated the non-exchangeable δ2HVSMOW values of keratins EC1 (CBS) and EC2 (KHS), USGS hair standards, and a range of other nitrogenous widely used organic laboratory calibration materials (collagen and chitin) using pre-treatment with a preparation device designed to eliminate residual moisture and quantify exchangeable H. Results: The revised non-exchangeable δ2HVSMOW values of EC-1 (CBS) and EC-2 (KHS) keratin standard materials were –157.0 ± 0.9 and –35.3 ± 1.1 ‰, respectively. The revised values of USGS42 and USGS43 were –72.2 ± 0.9 and –44.2 ± 1.0 ‰, respectively, in excellent agreement with previous results. Conclusions: For routine H isotope analyses, with proper sample pre-treatment, we show that the Comparative Equilibration approach can provide accurate and reproducible non-exchangeable δ2H values among laboratories regardless of the reactor type used. © 2017 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.

	abstract = {Determining the geographic connections between breeding and nonbreeding populations, termed migratory connectivity, is critical to advancing our understanding of the ecology and conservation of migratory species. Assignment models based on stable isotopes historically have been an important tool for studying migratory connectivity of small-bodied species, but the low resolution of these assignments has generated interest into combining isotopes with other sources in information. Abundance is one of the most appealing data sources to include in isotope-based assignments, but there are currently no statistical methods or guidelines for optimizing the contribution of stable isotopes and abundance for inferring migratory connectivity. Using known-origin stable-hydrogen isotope samples of six Neotropical migratory bird species, we rigorously assessed the performance of assignment models that differentially weight the contribution of the isotope and abundance data. For two species with adequate sample sizes, we used Pareto optimality to determine the set of models that simultaneously minimized both assignment error rate and assignment area. We then assessed the ability of the top models from these two species to improve assignments of the remaining four species compared to assignments based on isotopes alone. We show that the increased precision of models that include abundance is often offset by a large increase in assignment error. However, models that optimally weigh the abundance data relative to the isotope data can result in higher precision and, in some cases, lower error than models based on isotopes alone. The top models, however, depended on the distribution of relative breeding abundance, with patchier distributions requiring stronger downweighting of abundance, and we present general guidelines for future studies. These results confirm that breeding abundance can be an important source of information for studies investigating broad-scale movements of migratory birds and potentially other taxa.},

It will be critical to incorporate an understanding of the ecological consequences of disease control – including those mediated by changes in human behavior – into management strategies, and to do so without propagating environmental injustice.

As it occurs in both habitats of tropical forests in Ecuador and Peru, Archaeoprepona demophon is one such exception. We compared patterns of occurrence of A. demophon in the canopy and understorey and population genomic variation for evidence of ecological and genetic differentiation between habitats. We found that butterfly occurrences in the canopy were largely uncorrelated with occurrences in the understorey at both localities, indicating independent demographic patterns in the two habitats. We also documented modest, significant genome-level differentiation at both localities. Genetic differentiation between habitat types (separated by approx. 20 m in elevation) was comparable to levels of differentiation between sampling locations (approx. 1500 km). We conclude that canopy and understorey populations of A. demophon represent incipient independent evolutionary units. These findings support the hypothesis that divergence between canopy and understorey-associated populations might be a mechanism generating insect diversity in the tropics.},

Using computerized flight simulators, we performed controlled experiments to test the ability of an obligate migrant butterfly (Vanessa cardui) to orient in seasonally advantageous directions (i.e. northwards in spring and southwards in autumn). We also investigated the compass mechanism used to select and maintain these headings. Laboratory-reared autumn-generation butterflies flown in the U.K. displayed a highly significant mean orientation towards the south-southwest, consistent with return migration to winter breeding sites. However, seasonally adaptive flight headings were not observed in wild-caught adults flown at the same time. Spring-generation adults caught in Gibraltar (presumed to be migrating from winter breeding sites in North Africa into Europe) showed no evidence of northward flight headings, but produced a wide scatter of flight headings with a mean direction towards the west. Butterflies flown in the simulators when the sky was not visible produced a random scatter of flight headings and less-directed flight tracks, providing evidence that migrating V. cardui use a sun compass to select and maintain their flight headings. However, when butterflies were subjected to a 6 h clock shift, no change in orientation was observed relative to the control group. Field evidence for a return migration in autumn by V. cardui is surprisingly scarce in the literature, but we conclude that the species does attempt such southward movements and that individuals use a sun compass to select their migratory heading. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

However, making such inferences requires discerning among the many alternative scenarios that could underlie any given mtDNA pattern. Next-generation sequencing methods provide large, multilocus data sets with increased power to resolve unusual mtDNA patterns. A mtDNA-based phylogeography of the Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) previously identified two sympatric, but divergent ({\textasciitilde}2\%) clades within the nominate subspecies group and a third clade that consisted of birds sampled from northwest Mexico. We revisited the phylogeography of this species using a population genomic data set to resolve the processes leading to the evolution of sympatric and divergent mtDNA lineages. We identified two genetic clusters in the genomic data set corresponding to (a) the nominate subspecies group and (b) northwestern Mexico birds. Following divergence, the nominate clade maintained a large, stable population, indicating that divergent mitochondrial lineages arose within a panmictic population. Simulations based on parameter estimates from this model further confirmed that this demographic history could produce observed levels of mtDNA diversity. Patterns of divergent, sympatric mtDNA lineages are frequently interpreted as admixture of historically isolated lineages. Our analyses reject this interpretation for Savannah sparrows and underscore the need for genomic data sets to resolve the evolutionary mechanisms behind anomalous, locus-specific patterns.},

	abstract = {We review commonly used population definitions under both the ecological paradigm (which emphasizes demographic cohesion) and the evolutionary paradigm (which emphasizes reproductive cohesion) and find that none are truly operational. We suggest several quantitative criteria that might be used to determine when groups of individuals are different enough to be considered 'populations'. Units for these criteria are migration rate (m) for the ecological paradigm and migrants per generation (Nm) for the evolutionary paradigm. These criteria are then evaluated by applying analytical methods to simulated genetic data for a finite island model. Under the standard parameter set that includes L = 20 High mutation (microsatellite-like) loci and samples of S = 50 individuals from each of n = 4 subpopulations, power to detect departures from panmixia was very high (∼100\%; P {\textless} 0.001) even with high gene flow (Nm = 25). A new method, comparing the number of correct population assignments with the random expectation, performed as well as a multilocus contingency test and warrants further consideration. Use of Low mutation (allozyme-like) markers reduced power more than did halving S or L. Under the standard parameter set, power to detect restricted gene flow below a certain level X (H0: Nm {\textless} X) can also be high, provided that true Nm ≤ 0.5X. Developing the appropriate test criterion, however, requires assumptions about several key parameters that are difficult to estimate in most natural populations. Methods that cluster individuals without using a priori sampling information detected the true number of populations only under conditions of moderate or low gene flow (Nm ≤ 5), and power dropped sharply with smaller samples of loci and individuals. A simple algorithm based on a multilocus contingency test of allele frequencies in pairs of samples has high power to detect the true number of populations even with Nm = 25 but requires more rigorous statistical evaluation. The ecological paradigm remains challenging for evaluations using genetic markers, because the transition from demographic dependence to independence occurs in a region of high migration where genetic methods have relatively little power. Some recent theoretical developments and continued advances in computational power provide hope that this situation may change in the future. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Our approach represents a principled model-based combination of genetic and isotope data from samples collected on the breeding grounds and is able to achieve levels of assignment accuracy that exceed those of either method alone. When applied at large scale the method can reveal specific migratory connectivity patterns. In Wilson's warblers (Wilsonia pusilla), we detect a subgroup of birds wintering in Baja that uniquely migrate preferentially from the coastal Pacific Northwest.

First, we conducted the most comprehensive analysis of neutral genetic population structure to date to revisit the null hypothesis of panmixia in this species. Second, we used this data to provide the first estimates of contemporary effective population size (Ne) and to document temporal variation in effective number of breeders (Nb) in American eel. Third, we tested for statistical associations between temporal variation in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the effective number of breeders and two indices of recruit abundance. A total of 2142 eels from 32 sampling locations were genotyped with 18 microsatellite loci. All measures of differentiation were essentially zero, and no evidence for significant spatial or temporal genetic differentiation was found. The panmixia hypothesis should thus be accepted for this species. Nb estimates varied by a factor of 23 among 12 cohorts, from 473 to 10 999. The effective population size N e was estimated at 10 532 (95\% CI, 9312-11 752). This study also showed that genetically based demographic indices, namely Nb and allelic richness (Ar), can be used as surrogates for the abundance of breeders and recruits, which were both shown to be positively influenced by variation during high (positive) NAO phases. Thus, long-term genetic monitoring of American glass eels at several sites along the North American Atlantic coast would represent a powerful and efficient complement to census monitoring to track demographic fluctuations and better understand their causes. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Direct tracking of small passerines throughout the annual cycle is now possible with archival light-level geolocators. Our objective was to evaluate whether δ2HF and geolocators produce similar breeding-origin assignments for the same individual birds sampled during the non-breeding season. We estimated breeding origin with geolocators and δ2HF and validated those estimates using a population of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) from a known breeding location at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire. We also deployed geolocators on Ovenbirds in Jamaica and Florida during March 2010–2011. We performed stable hydrogen isotope analysis on feathers of birds whose geolocators we recovered (Jamaica: n = 9; Florida: n = 3). Probabilistic assignments of δ2HF that accounted for regional variation in feather-isotope discrimination predicted breeding origins that agreed with kernel density estimates of origin derived from geolocators. By contrast, assignments of δ2HF using the common assumption of a consistent feather-isotope discrimination across space predicted breeding origins that overlapped minimally with those from geolocators. Finally, Bayesian analyses that incorporated prior information of Ovenbird abundance across the breeding range yielded more accurate assignments for both site-independent and site-specific discrimination factors. Our findings suggest that creating more detailed feather isoscapes by increasing the number of validation locations and sampling underrepresented portions of species distributions could increase the accuracy of geographic assignments using δ2HF.},

	abstract = {Few hosts have many parasites while many hosts have few parasites. This axiom of macroparasite aggregation is so pervasive it is considered a general law in disease ecology, with important implications for the dynamics of host-parasite systems. Because of these dynamical implications, a significant amount of work has explored both the various mechanisms leading to parasite aggregation patterns and how to infer mechanism from these patterns. However, as many disease mechanisms can produce similar aggregation patterns, it is not clear whether aggregation itself provides any additional information about mechanism. Here we apply a "constraint-based" approach developed in macroecology that allows us to explore whether parasite aggregation contains any additional information beyond what is provided by mean parasite load. We tested two constraint-based null models, both of which were constrained on the total number of parasites P and hosts H found in a sample, using data from 842 observed amphibian host-trematode parasite distributions. We found that constraint-based models captured 85\% of the observed variation in host-parasite distributions, suggesting that the constraints P and H contain much of the information about the shape of the host-parasite distribution. However, we also found that extending the constraint-based null models can identify the potential role of known aggregating mechanisms (such as host heterogeneity) and disaggregating mechanisms (such as parasite-induced host mortality) in constraining host-parasite distributions. Thus, by providing robust null models, constraint-based approaches can help guide investigations aimed at detecting biological processes that directly affect parasite aggregation above and beyond those that indirectly affect aggregation through P and H.},

Gmelin, 1789)) feathers collected during the breeding season at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia, USA, to determine fidelity to the study site. We compared δD values in feathers of birds with known molt locations and birds with unknown molt locations. Mean feather value of δD was -24.8‰ (SD = 10.5‰, range = -48.0‰ to -5.5‰), and we were unable to determine a site-specific signature to assess fidelity of breeders within our sample. We used an information criterion approach to evaluate multiple hypotheses to explain the high variation in δD, and the geographic location of sample sites within the study area was selected as the best model. Feather δD values were higher than expected from mean growing-season rainfall δD values predicted for our study site. We discuss possible explanations for the enriched δD values and postulate that heat stress during molt may have contributed to our results. We suggest that future stable isotope data collection consider the potential for small-scale variation in feather δD values; information on diet gathered simultaneously with feather samples may be valuable for future studies. © 2006 NRC.},

	abstract = {Tracking migratory animals has benefitted using measurements of naturally occurring stable isotopes of hydrogen (δ2H) in keratinous tissues such as hair and feathers to link animal origins to continental patterns or isoscapes of δ2H in precipitation. However, for most taxa, much less information exists on the use of stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O) despite the fact that δ2H and δ18O are strongly linked in environmental waters through the meteoric relationship and the possibility of using both isotopes to infer greater information on origins and climatic conditions where tissues are grown. A fundamental requirement of using stable isotopes to assign individuals and populations to origins is the development of a rescaling function linking environmental food web signals to the tissue of interest and for birds, this has not been carried out. Here, we derived the relationship between H and O isotopes in known source feathers of 104 individuals representing 11 species of insectivorous passerines sampled across the strong precipitation isoscape of North America. We determined again a strong expected relationship between feather δ2H (δ2Hf) and long-term amount-weighted precipitation δ2H (δ2Hp; r2 = 0.77), but the corresponding relationship between δ18Of and δ18Op was poor (r2 = 0.32) for the same samples. This suggests that δ2H measurements are currently more useful for assignment of insectivorous songbirds to precipitation isoscapes but does not preclude other uses of the δ18Of data. Currently, mechanisms responsible for the decoupling of H and O isotopes in food webs is poorly known, and we advocate a much broader sampling of both isotopes in the same keratinous tissues across precipitation isotope gradients and across taxa to resolve this issue and to increase the power of using water isotopes to track migratory animals.},

	abstract = {Large numbers of the Globe Skimmer dragonfly (Pantala flavescens) appear in the Maldives every October-December. Since they cannot breed on these largely waterless islands, it has recently been suggested that they are "falling out" during a trans-oceanic flight from India to East Africa. In addition, it has been suggested that this trans-oceanic crossing is just one leg of a multi-generational migratory circuit covering about 14,000-18,000 km. The dragonflies are presumed to accomplish this remarkable feat by riding high-altitude winds associated with the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). While there is considerable evidence for this migratory circuit, much of that evidence is circumstantial. Recent developments in the application of stable isotope analyses to track migratory dragonflies include the establishment of direct associations between dragonfly wing chitin δ2H values with those derived from long-term δ2H precipitation isoscapes. We applied this approach by measuring wing chitin δ2H values in 49 individual Pantala flavescens from the November-December migration through the Maldives. Using a previously established spatial calibration algorithm for dragonflies, the mean wing δ2H value of -117±16 ‰ corresponded to a predicted mean natal ambient water source of -81 ‰, which resulted in a probabilistic origin of northern India, and possibly further north and east. This strongly suggests that the migratory circuit of this species in this region is longer than previously suspected, and could possibly involve a remarkable trans-Himalayan high-altitude traverse. © 2012 Hobson et al.},

	abstract = {Aim: We examined three potential enhancements of the stable isotope technique for elucidating migratory connectivity in birds inhabiting poorly studied areas, illustrated for Eurasian cranes (Grus grus) that overwinter in and migrate through Israel. First, we examined the use of oxygen stable isotopes (δ18O), seldom applied for this purpose. Second, we examined the relationship between ambient water δ18O and hydrogen stable isotope (δ2H) values derived from various models, to determine the geographical origins of migrants. Third, we introduced the use of probabilistic distribution modelling to refine the assignment to origin of migrants lacking detailed distribution maps. Location: Feather samples were collected in the Hula Valley (northern Israel) and across the species breeding range in north Eurasia. Methods: We analysed δ18O and δ2H in primary and secondary flight feathers using standard mass spectrometry. The maximum entropy (maxent) model was used to map the probability surface of potential breeding areas, as a Bayesian prior for assigning Hula Valley cranes to potential breeding grounds. Results: We found that δ18O was suitable and informative. The soil water isoscape performed better for δ18O while precipitation isoscape was preferable for δ2H. The maxent-based probability surface largely refined assignments. Overall, most ({\textgreater}85\%) cranes were assigned to the area west of the Ural Mountains, but for two individuals, most of the assigned area ({\textgreater}90\%) was farther east, suggesting, for the first time, that Eurasian cranes may undertake the North Asia-Middle East (and perhaps Africa) migration flyway. Main conclusions: Our results call for broader use of δ18O in migratory connectivity studies and for application of probabilistic distribution modelling. We also encourage investigation of factors determining δ18O and δ2H integration into animal tissues. The proposed framework may help improve our understanding of migratory connectivity of species inhabiting previously unexplored areas and thus contribute to the development of efficient conservation plans.},

	abstract = {Conservation of migratory wildlife requires knowledge of migratory connectivity between breeding and non-breeding locations. Stable isotopes in combination with geographical isotopic patterns (isoscapes) can provide inferences about migratory connectivity. This study examines whether such an approach can be used to infer wintering areas in sub-Saharan Africa, where we lack such knowledge for many species, but where this method has not been used widely. We measured δ2H, δ13C and δ15N in winter-grown feathers of a breeding Swiss and Spanish population of European hoopoe Upupa epops-a typical Palaearctic-Afrotropical migrant. δ2H values predicted that {\textasciitilde}70 \% of the hoopoes spent the non-breeding season in the western portion of their potential winter range. This was corroborated by a shallow east-west gradient in feather-δ2H values of museum specimens from known African origin across the potential winter range and by the recovery of Swiss hoopoes marked with geolocators. Hoopoes categorized as from eastern versus western regions of the wintering range were further delineated spatially using feather δ13C and δ15N. δ15N showed no trend, whereas adults were more enriched in 13C in the western portion of the range, with eastern adults being in addition more depleted in 13C than eastern juveniles. This suggests that eastern juveniles may have occupied more xeric habitats than sympatric adults. We demonstrated that stable isotopes, especially δ2H, could only very roughly delineate the winter distribution of a trans-Saharan Palaearctic migrant restricted primarily to the Sahelian and savanna belt south of the Sahara. Further refinements of precipitation isoscapes for Africa as well the development of isoscapes for δ13C and δ15N may improve assignment of this and other migrants. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0035137},
	abstract = {Background: Tracking small migrant organisms worldwide has been hampered by technological and recovery limitations and sampling bias inherent in exogenous markers. Naturally occurring stable isotopes of H (δ 2H) in feathers provide an alternative intrinsic marker of animal origin due to the predictable spatial linkage to underlying hydrologically driven flow of H isotopes into foodwebs. This approach can assess the likelihood that a migrant animal originated from a given location(s) within a continent but requires a robust algorithm linking H isotopes in tissues of interest to an appropriate hydrological isotopic spatio-temporal pattern, such as weighted-annual rainfall. However, a number of factors contribute to or alter expected isotopic patterns in animals. We present results of an extensive investigation into taxonomic and environmental factors influencing feather δ 2H patterns across North America. Principal Findings: Stable isotope data were measured from 544 feathers from 40 species and 140 known locations. For δ 2H, the most parsimonious model explaining 83\% of the isotopic variance was found with amount-weighted growing-season precipitation δ 2H, foraging substrate and migratory strategy. Conclusions/Significance: This extensive H isotopic analysis of known-origin feathers of songbirds in North America and elsewhere reconfirmed the strong coupling between tissue δ 2H and global hydrologic δ 2H patterns, and accounting for variance associated with foraging substrate and migratory strategy, can be used in conservation and research for the purpose of assigning birds and other species to their approximate origin. © 2012 Hobson et al.

	abstract = {Background: Recent studies have proposed that birds migrating short distances migrate at an overall slower pace, minimizing energy expenditure, while birds migrating long distances minimize time spent on migration to cope with seasonal changes in environmental conditions. Methods: We evaluated variability in the migration strategies of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus), a generalist species with flexible foraging and flight behaviour. We tracked one population of long distance migrants and three populations of short distance migrants, and compared the directness of their migration routes, their overall migration speed, their travel speed, and their use of stopovers. Results: Our research revealed that Herring Gulls breeding in the eastern Arctic migrate long distances to spend the winter in the Gulf of Mexico, traveling more than four times farther than gulls from Atlantic Canada during autumn migration. While all populations used indirect routes, the long distance migrants were the least direct. We found that regardless of the distance the population traveled, Herring Gulls migrated at a slower overall migration speed than predicted by Optimal Migration Theory, but the long distance migrants had higher speeds on travel days. While long distance migrants used more stopover days overall, relative to the distance travelled all four populations used a similar number of stopover days. Conclusions: When taken in context with other studies, we expect that the migration strategies of flexible generalist species like Herring Gulls may be more influenced by habitat and food resources than migration distance.},

	abstract = {Since its introduction into the biomedical literature, statistical significance testing (abbreviated as SST) caused much debate. The aim of this perspective article is to review frequent fallacies and misuses of SST in the biomedical field and to review a potential way out of the fallacies and misuses associated with SSTs. Two frequentist schools of statistical inference merged to form SST as it is practised nowadays: the Fisher and the Neyman-Pearson school. The P-value is both reported quantitatively and checked against the α-level to produce a qualitative dichotomous measure (significant/ nonsignificant). However, a P-value mixes the estimated effect size with its estimated precision. Obviously, it is not possible to measure these two things with one single number. For the valid interpretation of SSTs, a variety of presumptions and requirements have to be met. We point here to four of them: study size, correct statistical model, correct causal model, and absence of bias and confounding. It has been stated that the P-value is perhaps the most misunderstood statistical concept in clinical research. As in the social sciences, the tyranny of SST is still highly prevalent in the biomedical literature even after decades of warnings against SST. The ubiquitous misuse and tyranny of SST threatens scientific discoveries and may even impede scientific progress. In the worst case, misuse of significance testing may even harm patients who eventually are incorrectly treated because of improper handling of P-values. For a proper interpretation of study results, both estimated effect size and estimated precision are necessary ingredients. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In order to better characterize and understand the isotopic seasonality of precipitation and to advance applications such as the inversion of isotope/climate relationships for paleoclimate seasonality reconstruction, these relationships are analyzed using a database of precipitation isotope ratio observations and gridded maps. The results confirm the overwhelming dominance of temperature- and precipitation amount-related isotopic seasonality within specific, well-defined geographic zones and indicate that these zones encompass most of Earth's continental land surface. Analysis of global maps of precipitation isotopic seasonality, however, indicates spatially patterned variation in isotope/climate relationships, including patterns related to continentality in temperature-dominated regions and meridional trends in amount-dominated areas. These features reflect more complex climatological controls on isotope seasonality and suggest limitations and opportunities for paleoclimate reconstruction using isotopic archives.

	abstract = {Understanding the role of biotic interactions in shaping natural communities is a long-standing challenge in ecology. It is particularly pertinent to parasite communities sharing the same host communities and individuals, as the interactions among parasites—both competition and facilitation—may have far-reaching implications for parasite transmission and evolution. Aggregated parasite burdens may suggest that infected host individuals are either more prone to infection, or that infection by a parasite species facilitates another, leading to a positive parasite–parasite interaction. However, parasite species may also compete for host resources, leading to the prediction that parasite–parasite associations would be generally negative, especially when parasite species infect the same host tissue, competing for both resources and space. We examine the presence and strength of parasite associations using hierarchical joint species distribution models fitted to data on resident parasite communities sampled on over 1300 small mammal individuals across 22 species and their resident parasite communities. On average, we detected more positive associations between infecting parasite species than negative, with the most negative associations occurring when two parasite species infected the same host tissue, suggesting that parasite species associations may be quantifiable from observational data. Overall, our findings suggest that parasite community prediction at the level of the individual host is possible, and that parasite species associations may be detectable in complex multi-species communities, generating many hypotheses concerning the effect of host community changes on parasite community composition, parasite competition within infected hosts, and the drivers of parasite community assembly and structure.},

	abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus, Linnaeus, 1758) are comprised of two migratory populations separated by the Rocky Mountains and are renowned for their long-distance movements among the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Both populations have declined over several decades across North America prompting all three countries to evaluate conservation efforts. Monitoring monarch distribution and abundance is a necessary aspect of ongoing management in Canada where they are a species at risk. We used presence-only data from two citizen science data sets to estimate the annual breeding distribution of monarch butterflies in Canada between 2000 and 2015. Monarch breeding distribution in Canada varied widely among years owing to natural variation, and when considering the upper 95\% of the probability of occurrence, the annual mean breeding distribution in Canada was 484 943 km2 (min: 173 449 km2; max: 1 425 835 km2). The area of occurrence was approximately an order of magnitude larger in eastern Canada than in western Canada. Habitat restoration for monarch butterflies in Canada should prioritize productive habitats in southern Ontario where monarchs occur annually and, therefore, likely contribute most to the long-term viability of monarchs in eastern North America. Overall, our assessment sets the geographic context to develop successful management strategies for monarchs in Canada.},

	abstract = {Pantala flavescens (Fabricius 1798) (Odonata: Libellulidae) is one of the most common species of migratory dragonflies. P. flavescens adults were captured by a searchlight trap on Beihuang Island (BH Island; 38°24′N, 120°55′E) from 2003 to 2016, where there is no freshwater. This inspired our research to analyze the pattern of seasonal migration and population dynamics. Stable hydrogen isotope measurement and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian IntegratedTrajectory (HYSPLIT) were used to simulate the migration pathway of P. flavescens between different breeding habitats.The results showed that there was no significant difference among population numbers of this overseas migration across years (F13, 2161 = 0.85, P = 0.604); however, the numbers were significantly different across months (F5, 2161 = 3.91, P = 0.003). Our geospatial natal assignment model suggested that P. flavescens trapped on BH were originated in different geographical regions and might have three movement strategies: wandering around northern China and north-bound (positive) and south-bound (negative) movements. Among them, the majority were engaged in wandering around northern China. Model simulations suggested that P. flavescens toured around BH.The results contribute to the knowledge of P. flavescens population ecology in a large-scale geographic region and will aid in the prediction and interpretation of insect migration patterns in response to climate change.},

	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that individuals leave their natal area and select a breeding habitat non-randomly by relying upon information about their natal and future breeding environments. This variation in dispersal is not only based on external information (condition dependence) but also depends upon the internal state of individuals (phenotype dependence). As a consequence, not all dispersers are of the same quality or search for the same habitats. In addition, the individual's state is characterized by morphological, physiological or behavioural attributes that might themselves serve as a cue altering the habitat choice of conspecifics. These combined effects of internal and external information have the potential to generate complex movement patterns and could influence population dynamics and colonization processes. Here, we highlight three particular processes that link condition-dependent dispersal, phenotype-dependent dispersal and habitat choice strategies: (1) the relationship between the cause of departure and the dispersers' phenotype; (2) the relationship between the cause of departure and the settlement behaviour and (3) the concept of informed dispersal, where individuals gather and transfer information before and during their movements through the landscape. We review the empirical evidence for these processes with a special emphasis on vertebrate and arthropod model systems, and present case studies that have quantified the impacts of these processes on spatially structured population dynamics. We also discuss recent literature providing strong evidence that individual variation in dispersal has an important impact on both reinforcement and colonization success and therefore must be taken into account when predicting ecological responses to global warming and habitat fragmentation. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

	abstract = {Dispersal has recently gained much attention because of its crucial role in the conservation and evolution of species facing major environmental changes such as habitat loss and fragmentation, climate change, and their interactions. Butterflies have long been recognized as ideal model systems for the study of dispersal and a huge amount of data on their ability to disperse has been collected under various conditions. However, no single 'best' method seems to exist leading to the co-occurrence of various approaches to study butterfly mobility, and therefore a high heterogeneity among data on dispersal across this group. Accordingly, we here reviewed the knowledge accumulated on dispersal and mobility in butterflies, to detect general patterns. This meta-analysis specifically addressed two questions. Firstly, do the various methods provide a congruent picture of how dispersal ability is distributed across species? Secondly, is dispersal species-specific? Five sources of data were analysed: multisite mark-recapture experiments, genetic studies, experimental assessments, expert opinions, and transect surveys. We accounted for potential biases due to variation in genetic markers, sample sizes, spatial scales or the level of habitat fragmentation. We showed that the various dispersal estimates generally converged, and that the relative dispersal ability of species could reliably be predicted from their relative vagrancy (records of butterflies outside their normal habitat). Expert opinions gave much less reliable estimates of realized dispersal but instead reflected migration propensity of butterflies. Within-species comparisons showed that genetic estimates were relatively invariable, while other dispersal estimates were highly variable. This latter point questions dispersal as a species-specific, invariant trait. © 2010 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

Green darners exhibited distinct stopover and migration days. On average, they migrated every 2.9±0.3 days, and their average net advance was 58±11 km in 6.1±0.9 days (11.9±2.8 km d-1) in a generally southward direction (186±52°).

The migratory patterns and apparent decision rules of green darners are strikingly similar to those proposed for songbirds, and may represent a general migration strategy for long-distance migration of organisms with high self-propelled flight speeds. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

The farthest estimated distance a monarch travelled in a single day was 143 km at a wind-assisted groundspeed of 31 km h21 (8.7 m s-1) and the farthest estimated distance a green darner travelled in a single day was 122 km with a wind-assisted groundspeed of up to 77 km h21 (21.5 m s-1).

Two novel radar designs introduced in the late 1990s have significantly enhanced observing capabilities. Radar-based research now encompasses foraging as well as migration and is increasingly focused on flight behavior and the environmental cues luencing it. Migrant moths have been shown to employ sophisticated orientation and height-selection strategies that maximize displacements in seasonally appropriate directions; they appear to have an internal compass and to respond to turbulence features in the airflow. Tracks of foraging insects demonstrate compensation for wind drift and use of optimal search paths to locate resources. Further improvements to observing capabilities, and employment in operational as well as research roles, appear feasible. © 2011 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

The parasite was recorded throughout the day in conditions of convective uplift suggesting that extensive diurnal dispersal occurred on the prevailing wind at distances varying from 100 to 300 km per day. Take-off at dusk of its major host, the Australian plague locust (Chortoicetes terminiferaWalker), was observed in one period and direct aerial sampling at 100-300 m altitude subsequently confirmed the presence of this locust in the upper airflow at night. The mean wind vector did not differ greatly between day or night during this sampling period, suggesting that parasite and host were dispersed independently over the same general area by prevailing winds.

	abstract = {Vast numbers of insects annually engage in trans-latitudinal migration and thereby impact structure and functioning of natural and man-made ecosystems. In eastern Asia, long-distance migration has historically been studied for single insect species rather than diverse species complexes. Here, we assessed migration dynamics of multiple economically important migratory species on an island in the Bohai Strait, China. Drawing upon 15-year trapping records of {\textgreater} 2.5 million specimens, we unveil inter- and intra-annual shifts in the species composition and abundance of migrant individuals. Migrants belonged to 9 orders and 36 families, primarily consisting of Lepidoptera (79\% individuals), Odonata (8\%), and Coleoptera (4\%). Seven crop-feeding noctuids, e.g., Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), Mythimna separata (Walker), represented 54\% of the total trapping records. Trap catches exhibited marked seasonal variation, with the highest capture rate during early fall. Yearly abundance of migratory noctuids was coupled with that of their associated natural enemies. Although overall trap catches did not decrease over the monitoring period, the entire order of Odonata experienced a 14.1\% annual rate of decline. Furthermore, 19 out of 108 species exhibited a progressively declining abundance over time, including the cosmopolitan cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) and the insectivorous dragonfly Pantala flavescens Fabricius. Our work provides unprecedented insights into insect migration dynamics in eastern Asia, helps fine-tune forecasting and early-warning systems of crop pests, and thereby guides integrated pest management within local agro-landscapes. Also, a long-term tracking of migrant insect populations can shine light on the fate of (insect-mediated) ecosystem services and trophic dynamic processes at a macroscale.},

Opportunistic observations made by citizen scientist groups may be an excellent alternative to systematic surveys. From 1992 to 2010, 19,779 butterfly surveys were made by amateur naturalists in Massachusetts, a geographically small state located at the convergence of northern and southern bioclimatic zones in eastern North America. From these data, we estimated population trends for nearly all butterfly species (100 of 116 species present) using list-length analysis. Population trajectories indicate increases of many species near their northern range limits and declines in nearly all species (17 of 21) near their southern range limits. Certain life-history traits, especially overwintering stage, were strongly associated with declines. Our results suggest that a major, climate-induced shift of North American butterflies, characterized by northward expansions of warm-adapted and retreat of cold-adapted species, is underway. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

While species-specific dispersal behaviours are the product of each species' unique evolutionary history, there may be distinct interspecific patterns of covariation between dispersal and other traits ('dispersal syndromes') due to their shared evolutionary history or shared environments. Using dispersal, phylogeny and trait data for 15 terrestrial and semi-terrestrial animal Orders ({\textgreater} 700 species), we tested for the existence and consistency of dispersal syndromes across species. At this taxonomic scale, dispersal increased linearly with body size in omnivores, but decreased above a critical length in herbivores and carnivores. Species life history and ecology significantly influenced patterns of covariation, with higher phylogenetic signal of dispersal in aerial dispersers compared with ground dwellers and stronger evidence for dispersal syndromes in aerial dispersers and ectotherms, compared with ground dwellers and endotherms. Our results highlight the complex role of dispersal in the evolution of species life-history strategies: good dispersal ability was consistently associated with high fecundity and survival, and in aerial dispersers it was associated with early maturation. We discuss the consequences of these findings for species evolution and range shifts in response to future climate change. © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

	abstract = {As dispersal plays a key role in gene flow among populations, its evolutionary dynamics under environmental changes is particularly important. The inter-dependency of dispersal with other life history traits may constrain dispersal evolution, and lead to the indirect selection of other traits as a by-product of this inter-dependency. Identifying the dispersal's relationships to other life-history traits will help to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of dispersal, and the consequences for species persistence and ecosystem functioning under global changes. Dispersal may be linked to other life-history traits as their respective evolutionary dynamics may be inter-dependent, or, because they are mechanistically related to each other. We identify traits that are predicted to co-vary with dispersal, and investigated the correlations that may constrain dispersal using published information on butterflies. Our quantitative analysis revealed that (1) dispersal directly correlated with demographic traits, mostly fecundity, whereas phylogenetic relationships among species had a negligible influence on this pattern, (2) gene flow and individual movements are correlated with ecological specialisation and body size, respectively and (3) routine movements only affected short-distance dispersal. Together, these results provide important insights into evolutionary dynamics under global environmental changes, and are directly applicable to biodiversity conservation. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Stable isotope analysis has the potential to determine natal origins, but is difficult to achieve for samples as small as a single insect. Here an analytical modification to measure small samples was successfully trialled as a means to supply evidence as to the local or exotic natal origin of the intercepted BMSB specimen. RESULTS: Sufficient analytical sensitivity was achieved using a modified isotope ratio mass spectrometry method, involving thermolysis and carbon monoxide cryofocusing, to enable the simultaneous analysis of δ2H and δ18O from wings of the post-border BMSB sample. The values were much lower than those of the New Zealand green vegetable bug, used as a local reference. However, they fell within the range of those for BMSB of Northern Hemisphere origin intercepted at the New Zealand border over the same time period, specifically overlapping with the USA and Italy, but not China. CONCLUSION: The isotope signature of the post-border detected BMSB suggested a significantly cooler climate than the North Island of New Zealand, indicating that it was a new arrival and did not represent an established population. © 2019 The Authors.

We analysed tail feathers from birds of different age and sex collected from a range of different breeding sites across Europe. The site of moult had a large effect on elemental composition of feathers of birds, both at the European and African moulting sites. Analysis of feathers of nestlings with known origin suggested that the elemental composition of feathers depended largely upon the micro-geographical location of the colony. The distance between moulting areas could not explain the level of differences in trace elements. Analysis of feathers grown by the same individuals on the African wintering grounds and in the following breeding season in Europe showed a large difference in composition indicating that moulting site affects elemental composition. Tail feathers moulted in winter in Africa by adults breeding in different European regions differed markedly in elemental composition, indicating that they used different moulting areas. Analysis of tail feathers of the same adult individuals in two consecutive years showed that sand martins in their first and second wintering season grew feathers with largely similar elemental composition, although the amounts of several elements in tail feathers of the older birds was lower. There was no difference between the sexes in the elemental composition of their feathers grown in Africa. Investigation of the trace element composition of feathers could be a useful method for studying similarity among groups of individuals in their use of moulting areas.},

	abstract = {Variation in movement across time and space fundamentally shapes the abundance and distribution of populations. Although a variety of approaches model structured population dynamics, they are limited to specific types of spatially structured populations and lack a unifying framework. Here, we propose a unified network-based framework sufficiently novel in its flexibility to capture a wide variety of spatiotemporal processes including metapopulations and a range of migratory patterns. It can accommodate different kinds of age structures, forms of population growth, dispersal, nomadism and migration, and alternative life-history strategies. Our objective was to link three general elements common to all spatially structured populations (space, time and movement) under a single mathematical framework. To do this, we adopt a network modeling approach. The spatial structure of a population is represented by a weighted and directed network. Each node and each edge has a set of attributes which vary through time. The dynamics of our network-based population is modeled with discrete time steps. Using both theoretical and real-world examples, we show how common elements recur across species with disparate movement strategies and how they can be combined under a unified mathematical framework. We illustrate how metapopulations, various migratory patterns, and nomadism can be represented with this modeling approach. We also apply our network-based framework to four organisms spanning a wide range of life histories, movement patterns, and carrying capacities. General computer code to implement our framework is provided, which can be applied to almost any spatially structured population. This framework contributes to our theoretical understanding of population dynamics and has practical management applications, including understanding the impact of perturbations on population size, distribution, and movement patterns. By working within a common framework, there is less chance that comparative analyses are colored by model details rather than general principles.},

	abstract = {As a result of predictable large-scale continental gradients in the isotopic composition of precipitation, stable isotopes of hydrogen (δ2H) are useful endogenous markers for delineating long-distance movements of animals. Models to predict patterns of δ2H in precipitation (δ2Hp), and consequently determine likely geographic origin of migratory animals, have traditionally used static, amount-weighted long-term average values of δ2Hp over the growing season. However, animal tissues reflect H incorporated from food webs that integrate precipitation over a single year's growing season or portions thereof. Inter-annual variation in precipitation and other climatic variables may lead to deviations from predictions derived from long-term mean precipitation isotopic values and could therefore lead to assignment errors for specific years and locations that are atypical. We examined whether using biologically relevant short-term δ2Hp isoscapes can improve estimates of geographic origin in comparison with long-term isoscapes. Using δ2H data from known-origin tissues of two migratory organisms in North America and Europe, we compared the accuracy, precision and similarity of assigned origins using both short- and long-term δ2Hp isoscapes. Relative to long-term δ2Hp isoscapes, using short-term isoscapes for assignment often resulted in dissimilar regions of likely origin but did not significantly improve accuracy or precision. This was likely due to reduced spatial coverage in the data used to generate the short-term δ2Hp isoscapes. We suggest that continued efforts to collect precipitation isotope data with a large spatiotemporal range will benefit future research on incorporating temporal variation in the amount and isotopic composition of precipitation into geospatial assignment models.},

	abstract = {East African elephants have been hunted for their ivory for millennia but the nineteenth century witnessed strongly escalating demand from Europe and North America. It has been suggested that one consequence was that by the 1880s elephant herds along the coast had become scarce, and to meet demand, trade caravans trekked farther into interior regions of East Africa, extending the extraction frontier. The steady decimation of elephant populations coupled with the extension of trade networks have also been claimed to have triggered significant ecological and socio-economic changes that left lasting legacies across the region. To explore the feasibility of using an isotopic approach to uncover a 'moving frontier' of elephant extraction, we constructed a baseline isotope data set (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr) for historic East African elephants known to have come from three distinct regions (coastal, Rift Valley, and inland Lakes). Using the isotope results with other climate data and geographical mapping tools, it was possible to characterise elephants from different habitats across the region. This baseline data set was then used to provenance elephant ivory of unknown geographical provenance that was exported from East Africa during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to determine its likely origin. This produced a better understanding of historic elephant geography in the region, and the data have the potential to be used to provenance older archaeological ivories, and to inform contemporary elephant conservation strategies.},

While considerable effort has been expended developing 87Sr/86Sr baseline values across the Maya region, work in central Mexico is primarily focused on the Classic period urban center of Teotihuacan. This study adds to this important dataset by presenting bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr values across central Mexico focusing on the Basin of Mexico. This study therefore serves to expand the utility of strontium isotopes across a wider geographic region. A total of 63 plant and water samples were collected from 13 central Mexican sites and analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr on a Thermo-Finnigan Neptune multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). These data were analyzed alongside 16 published 87Sr/86Sr values from two additional sites within the region of interest. A five-cluster k-means model was then generated to determine which regions of the Basin of Mexico and greater central Mexico can and cannot be distinguished isotopically using 87Sr/86Sr values. Although the two clusters falling within the Basin of Mexico overlap in their local 87Sr/86Sr ranges, many locations within the Basin are distinguishable using 87Sr/86Sr values at the site-level. This study contributes to paleomobility studies within central Mexico by expanding knowledge of strontium isotope variability within the region, ultimately allowing researchers to detect intra-regional residential mobility and gain a greater understanding of the sociopolitical interactions between the Basin of Mexico and supporting outlying regions of central Mexico.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Strontium isotopes are valuable markers of provenance in a range of disciplines. Limited amounts of Sr in low-mass samples such as insects mean that conventional Sr isotope analysis precludes their use for geographic origins in many ecological studies or in applications such as biosecurity. Here we test the viability of using inductively coupled plasma tandem mass spectrometry (ICP-MS/MS) with N2O as a reaction gas for accurately determining Sr isotopes in insects with Sr {\textless} 100 ng. Methods: Strontium isotopes were determined in solution mode using ICP-MS/MS with 0.14 L/min N2O as a reaction gas to convert Sr+ into SrO+ for in-line separation of 87Sr from 87Rb. The Sr isotope reference standards NIST SRM 987, NIST SRM 1570a and NIST SRM 1547 were used to assess accuracy and reproducibility. Ten insect species collected from the wild as a proof-of-principle application were analysed for Sr concentration and Sr isotopes. Results: Using ICP-MS/MS we show for the first time that internal mass bias correction of 87Sr16O/86Sr16O based on 88Sr16O/86Sr16O works to give for NIST SRM 987 a 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7101 ± 0.012 (RSD = 0.17\%) and for NIST SRM 1570a a 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7100 ± 0.009 (RSD = 0.12\%), which are within error of the accepted values. The first 87Sr/86Sr ratio of NIST SRM 1547 is 0.7596 ± 0.0014. Strontium analyses were run on 0.8 mL of 0.25–0.5 ppb Sr, which equates to 2–4 ng of Sr. Strontium isotope analysis with a precision of {\textgreater}99.8\% can be achieved with in-line separation of 87Sr from 87Rb at least up to solutions with 25 ppb Rb. Conclusions: A minimum of 5 mg of insect tissue is required for Sr isotope analysis. This new ICP-MS/MS method enables Sr isotope analysis in single insects, allowing population-scale studies to be feasible and making possible applications with time-critical uses such as biosecurity.},

While recent studies have demonstrated the utility of high-resolution SNP-based genetic markers for identifying population-specific migratory patterns, the accuracy of this approach relative to other intrinsic tagging techniques has not yet been assessed. Here, using a straightforward application of Bayes’ Rule, we develop a method for combining inferences from high-resolution genetic markers, stable isotopes and habitat suitability models, to spatially infer the breeding origin of migrants captured anywhere along their migratory pathway. Using leave-one-out cross validation, we compare the accuracy of this combined approach with the accuracy attained using each source of data independently. Our results indicate that when each method is considered in isolation, the accuracy of genetic assignments far exceeded that of assignments based on stable isotopes or habitat suitability models. However, our joint assignment method consistently resulted in small, but informative increases in accuracy and did help to correct misassignments based on genetic data alone. We demonstrate the utility of the combined method by identifying previously undetectable patterns in the timing of migration in a North American migratory songbird, the Wilson's warbler. Overall, our results support the idea that while genetic data provides the most accurate method for tracking animals using intrinsic markers when each method is considered independently, there is value in combining all three methods. The resulting methods are provided as part of a new computationally efficient R-package, gaiah, allowing broad application of our statistical framework to other migratory animal systems.},

Geochemical tracers like strontium isotope ratios ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) have been used globally for over 40 years to discern human provenance and provide independent data to aid in repatriation efforts. To reliably apply this technology, landscape 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratio variability must be quantified. In Australia, only a few studies have used this technique and they are lacking in detail. Here, we present Australia's first regional strontium isotope ratio variability study. We measured strontium isotope ratios in soil, plant, water, and faunal material throughout Cape York, Queensland, the most northerly point of mainland Australia. Results show a close correlation between surface soil leachates, vegetation, surface water, and faunal 87 Sr/ 86 Sr results with extremely high values (0.78664) associated with ancient Precambrian geology. Our study suggests that measuring 87 Sr/ 86 Sr in soil and plant samples offer a reliable approach for assessing regional Sr isotope distribution, although the inclusion of mammal and freshwater samples is also important to assess exogenous inputs.

In a second experiment, apple trees transplanted in pots modified their original 87Sr/86Sr, which became progressively closer to the soil Sr isotope ratio. The addition of tap water and fertilizers, with different Sr isotopic signatures, slightly affected plant 87Sr/86Sr. Results confirm the potential of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio as a geographical tracer of agricultural commodities, but whenever the range of 87Sr/86Sr variability among soils from different geographical areas is narrow, the influence of external Sr-sources may smooth over these diversities.},

	abstract = {Accounting for migration and connectivity of mobile species across the annual cycle can present challenges for conservation and management efforts. The use of stable isotope approaches to examine the movements and ecology of wildlife has been widespread over the past two decades. Hydrogen stable isotope (δ2H) composition, in particular, has been frequently used to provide insight into the origin of migratory species, although isotopes of other elements are sometimes used. These intrinsic markers can yield valuable information about distributions of wildlife on a broad scale, with reduced labor and expense compared to tracking and telemetry. Many of the applications of isotopes to migratory species to date have addressed connectivity and origin, and studies in support of conservation biology are less common. In addition, there are few guides for how to best employ these methods for management. Therefore, we provide an overview for the wildlife conservation and management community on how stable isotope methods may be applied to conservation problems and a primer on the process for assigning geographic origins to terrestrial wildlife. We also discuss best practices for employing environmental isoscapes (isotopic distributions across landscapes), rescaling functions, and the assumptions required for assignment to origin while highlighting emerging issues in the modeling process. Finally, we provide example applications to illustrate these principles, and we explore strengths and limitations of this approach in a conservation context.},

Its use has been challenged by a recent suggestion that modern agricultural liming of farmlands exerts a serious imprint on the strontium isotope compositions of these waters. We here present results from a soil profile beneath agricultural farmland in the glaciogenic outwash plain of central West Jutland, Denmark, which show that strontium and its isotope composition derived from lime products is efficiently retained near the surface. Pore waters and bioavailable strontium from the acidic zone below the surface soil depict strontium isotope signatures that can best be explained by a mixture of silicate-derived and relic natural (not agriculturally added) carbonate-derived strontium. We therefore argue that agricultural liming does not contaminate groundwaters and groundwater-supported surface waters, rendering reference maps based on them relevant for modern and past provenance studies.},

We compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major parasite clades. On the basis of 53, 133 occurrences capturing the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model projections suggest that 5 to 10\% of these species are committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict that up to 30\% of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with unpredictable ecological consequences.},

However, the practice remains controversial especially after new evidence showed that both a group of commercially derived monarchs reared outdoors and a group of wild-derived but indoor-reared monarchs failed to orient south, unlike wild-derived monarchs reared outdoors. To more fully characterize the mechanisms responsible for the loss of orientation in both commercial and indoor-reared monarchs, we performed flight simulator experiments to determine: (i) whether any fraction of commercial monarchs maintains a southern heading over multiple tests, and (ii) whether indoor conditions with the addition of sunlight can induce southern flight in wild-derived monarchs. Commercial monarchs changed their flight direction more often over the course of multiple tests than wild-derived monarchs. While as a group the commercial monarchs did not fly south on average, a subset of individuals did orient south over multiple tests, potentially explaining the discordance between flight simulator assays and the recovery of tagged com- mercial monarchs at overwintering locations. We also show that even when raised indoors with sunlight, wild-derived monarchs did not consistently orient south in the flight simulator, though wild-derived monarchs reared outdoors did orient south. 1.},

However, the mechanisms driving individual differences in migratory tendency are still relatively poorly understood in most taxa, but may be influenced by morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits, controlled by phenotypic plasticity and the underlying genetic complex. Insects differ from vertebrates in that partial migration is often associated with pronounced morphological differences between migratory and resident phenotypes, such as wing presence or length. In contrast, the mechanisms influencing migratory tendency in wing-monomorphic insects is less clear. Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of terrestrial migrants, with trillions of animals moving across the globe annually, and understanding the drivers and extent of partial migration across populations will have considerable implications for ecosystem services, such as the management of pests and the conservation of threatened or beneficial species. Here, we present an overview of our current but incomplete knowledge of partial migration in insects. We discuss the factors that lead to the maintenance of partial migration within populations, and the conditions that may influence individual decision making, particularly in the context of individual fitness and reproductive tradeoffs. Finally, we highlight current gaps in knowledge and areas of future research that should prove fruitful in understanding the ecological and evolutionary drivers, and consequences of partial migration in insects.},

	abstract = {Aim: Climate change is driving many species towards higher latitudes and higher elevations. However, empirical studies documenting these changes have largely focused on presence/absence based range shifts in temperate regions. Studies in lowland tropical ecosystems that control for detection probabilities are especially lacking. Location: Hong Kong SAR, China. Methods: By analysing a 15-year trapping dataset of geometrid moths along a lowland elevation gradient (0–600 m) in Hong Kong, we used multiple metrics and approaches to estimate occurrence shifts with elevation, changes to range limits, and community-wide shifts in elevation. Our approaches used Bayesian occupancy models to account for false absences, which may bias naïve measures of range shifts over time. Results: Over the study period, we detected only subtle changes in forest cover but a notable increase in maximum temperatures ({\textasciitilde}0.5°C per decade) and extreme weather events. Of geometrid moths, one out of the 123 examined species exhibited increased occurrence probabilities across all elevations after accounting for uncertainty in detection; all other species exhibited no significant change in occupancy with elevation. However, at least two species became newly established in Hong Kong over the decade, and 32 species showed significant elevational shifts in lower or upper range limits. At the community level, geometrid moths showed a noticeable upslope shift at all but one of the examined sites. Main conclusions: The complex patterns observed highlight the difficulties and limitations in detecting climate change impacts on diverse tropical communities. Our conservative results indicate early responses of tropical species over a relatively short timespan to a decade of environmental change, and the necessity of long-term monitoring for providing insights into the management and conservation of vulnerable species.},

It has been found that the white rot polypore prefer angiosperm wood than gymnosperm wood because the angiosperm lignin is relatively easier to oxidize than gymnosperm lignin and therefore angiosperm trees might be preferred by more white rot polypores. Among the common species in tropics, like, Coriolopsis retropicta, Microporus xanthopus, Fomitopsis palustris, Hexagonia sulcata, Rigidoporus lineatus, etc. exhibited restricted distribution and very narrow host range. Among the Fomitopsis dochmius and F. rhodophaeus were the most widespread in occurrence as well as they exhibited a wide host range. Some species such as Cyclomyces tabacinus, Earliella scabrosa, Ganoderma australe, Microporus affinis, and Rigidoporus microporus were found mainly found on newly fallen trees while other species such as Antrodiella species, Nigroporus vinosus, Postia species, and Tyromyces species were found on well-decomposed trees. Species richness of wood-decaying basidiomycetes was higher in a primary forest plot than in a regenerating forest plot and suggested that a low frequency of tree fall in the regenerating forest reduced the species richness of wood-decaying basidiomycetes. Studies shown that Ganoderma australe has been collected from species in the Leguminosae, Dipterocarpaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, and Phellinus lamaensis has been collected from species in the Dipterocarpaceae and Meliaceae. Amongst all the families, genera of Fabaceae are found to be most susceptible, followed by Rosaceae, Myrtaceae, Cupressaceae, Caesalpiniaceae, Ericaceae, Euphorbiaceae and Lauraceae. The families like Meliaceae, Pinaceae, Rubiaceae Arecaceae, Fagaceae and Olecaceae were also reported as the most frequently infected families. Quercus was the most frequent host of Phellinus species. To ensure the well-being of the forests, management of coarse wood debris need to be strengthened.

The causes of variation in discrimination factors for carbon and nitrogen have been relatively well studied. In contrast, the discrimination factors for hydrogen have rarely been measured. We grew cabbage looper caterpillars (Trichoplusia ni) on cabbage (Brassica oleracea) plants irrigated with four treatments of deuterium-enriched water (δD = -131, -88, -48, and -2‰, respectively), allowing some of them to reach adulthood as moths. Tissue δD values of plants, caterpillars, and moths were linearly correlated with the isotopic composition of irrigation water. However, the slope of these relationships was less than 1, and hence, discrimination factors depended on the δD value of irrigation water. We hypothesize that this dependence is an artifact of growing plants in an environment with a common atmospheric δD value. Both caterpillars and moths were significantly enriched in deuterium relative to plants by {\textasciitilde}45‰ and 23‰ respectively, but the moths had lower tissue to plant discrimination factors than did the caterpillars. If the trophic enrichment documented here is universal, δD values must be accounted for in geographic assignment studies.

To address these concerns, we subjected wild An. gambiae s.l. mosquitoes to a high-altitude survival assay, followed by oviposition (egg laying) and blood feeding assays. Despite carrying out the survival assay under exceptionally harsh conditions that probably provide the lowest survival potential following high altitude flight, a high proportion of the mosquitoes survived for six and even eleven hours assay durations at 120-250m altitudes. Minimal differences in egg laying success were noted between mosquitoes exposed to high altitude survival assay and those kept near the ground. Similarly, minimal differences were found in the female ability to take an additional blood meal after oviposition between these groups. We conclude that similar to other high-altitude migrating insects, mosquitoes are able to withstand extended high-altitude flight and subsequently reproduce and transmit pathogens by blood feeding on new hosts. \#\#\# Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Studies addressing prehistoric mobility in animals typically use isotopic analyses of sequentially formed tissues, such as the growth layers in teeth, to infer physical movement on the landscape. Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr values), which vary geographically, are particularly useful for this purpose, especially when paired with stable oxygen isotope ratios (δ18O), which vary seasonally. Together, these two isotope systems can provide information about past animal movement patterns on a seasonal scale. However, while many studies have used 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O values from analyses of sequentially formed tissues for this purpose, there have been limited analyses on modern animals of known movement patterns across high-latitude regions. In this pilot study, we sequentially sampled and analyzed one second molar (M2) and two third molars (M3) from two bison (Bison bison bison) from the Delta bison herd, which resides in interior Alaska and has known and documented seasonal mobility patterns. The resulting 87Sr/86Sr values from the teeth were compared to a high-resolution 87Sr/86Sr isoscape for the region and were paired with δ18O analyses to determine whether the seasonal 87Sr/86Sr values matched the predicted values for each of the seasonal bison habitat areas. The results indicate that the 87Sr/86Sr and δ18O values reliably reflected the known seasonal mobility patterns of bison and suggest that this approach could be used to investigate the mobility patterns of prehistoric bison in Alaska and surrounding high-latitude regions.},

	abstract = {Multi-isotope analysis (e.g., Sr–Pb–O–H–C–N) of human scalp hair is routinely used in forensic investigations of human remains to constrain the geographic origin of unidentified bodies, and to investigate antemortem mobility patterns. However, while it is known that postmortem processes can affect the preservation of, or even overprint, the biogenic isotopic signatures in hair, the speed and nature of these processes have rarely been studied. This study investigates the effects of decomposition and environment on the H–Pb–Sr isotope compositions of human hair as well as the relationship between structural hair shaft degradation and isotopic signature change over time. Human scalp hair samples from four body donations were collected at different stages throughout gross body decomposition. The willed-donated bodies were placed to decompose outdoors at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) at Texas State University. Hair fibers from two of the donations were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution light microscopy (HRLM). Chemical and microbiological degradation of hair fibers occurred rapidly after placement of the body outdoors. Measurements of scalp hair isotopic composition demonstrated that H–Pb–Sr isotope ratios were altered within days after environmental exposure, presumably by deposition, leaching and/or exchange with the local bioavailable soil, and vapor. The degree of physical hair degradation and changes in H–Pb–Sr isotope composition were not correlated. We conclude that antemortem isotopic H–Pb–Sr isotope ratios are difficult to recover in hairs derived from decomposing whole bodies.},

	abstract = {Geographic origins of populations and migration patterns of several vertebrate and invertebrate species have been inferred from geographically distinct isotopesin their tissues. To test the hypothesis that feathers grown on different continents would reflect continental differences of δD in precipitation and have significantly different stable isotope ratios, we analyzed stable isotopes in two generations of feathers from three bird species (American and Pacific golden-plovers, Pluvialis dominica and P. fulva and northern wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe) that breed in North America and winter in South America, the South Pacific and Asia, and Africa. We found significant differences in stable isotope signatures between summer- and winter-grown feathers in the plovers, and our use of two generations of feathers provided similar variation to that reported in studies using larger sample sizes. Incontrast to plovers, no differences were detected in isotope values between summer- and winter-grown feathers in wheatears. Discriminant analyses separated 80\% of summer- and winter-grown feathers for each plover species. Nonetheless, an assignment with exclusion" method adapted from population genetics to impart a measure of confidence in assigning individuals to groups of origin resulted in an overall accuracy among plovers of only 41\%, compared with a 63\% assignment accuracy when the exclusion criterion was removed. Thus, we were unable to accurately assign feathers to origin of growth on the continental scale. Moreover, using δD expectations for North America, we were unable to assign summer-grown plover feathers to within better than several thousand kilometers of their true origins. We urge researchers to carefully consider the ecology and physiology of their study organisms, statistical methodology, and the interpretation of results when using stable isotopes to infer the geographic origins of feather growth. © Dt.

	abstract = {Tracking migratory movement of small animals with variable migration patterns is difficult with standard mark-recapture methods or genetic analysis. We used stable hydrogen isotope (δD) measurements of wings from European red admirals Vanessa atalanta to study several aspects of this species' migration. In the central part of southern Europe we found large differences in δD values between red admirals sampled in autumn and spring supporting the hypothesis that reproduction takes place in the Mediterranean region during winter. There was also an apparent influx to southern Europe in the spring of individuals with a more southerly origin, since many samples had higher δD values and similar to those expected from coastal areas of North Africa. We found a clear seasonal difference in the δD values of red admirals sampled in northern Europe. Spring migrants arriving in northern Europe generally had high δD values that indicated a southerly origin. In autumn, δD values suggested that red admirals were mostly from regions close to the sampling sites, but throughout the sampling period there were always individuals with δD values suggesting non-local origins. The migration pattern of this species is supposedly highly variable and plastic. δD differences between individuals in the western part of Europe were generally small making migratory patterns difficult to interpret. However, butterflies from western Europe were apparently isolated from those from north-eastern Europe, since δD values in the western region rarely corresponded to those of autumn migrants from the north-east. Use of δD data for inferring butterfly migration in Europe is complex, but our study showed that this technique can be used to help uncover previously unknown aspects of red admiral migration. © 2010 The Authors.},

	doi = {10.1101/2020.01.28.923490},
	abstract = {Copy number variants (CNVs) are a major component of genotypic and phenotypic variation in genomes. Yet, our knowledge on genotypic variation and evolution is often limited to single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the role of CNVs has been overlooked in non-model species, partly due to their challenging identification until recently. Here, we document the usefulness of reduced-representation sequencing data (RAD-seq) to detect and investigate copy number variants (CNVs) alongside SNPs in American lobster (Homarus americanus) populations. We conducted a comparative study to examine the potential role of SNPs and CNVs in local adaptation by sequencing 1141 lobsters from 21 sampling sites within the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence which experiences the highest yearly thermal variance of the Canadian marine coastal waters. Our results demonstrated that CNVs accounts for higher genetic differentiation than SNP markers. Contrary to SNPs for which no association was found, genetic-environment association revealed that 48 CNV candidates were significantly associated with the annual variance of sea surface temperature, leading to the genetic clustering of sampling locations despite their geographic separation. Altogether, we provide a strong empirical case that CNVs putatively contribute to local adaptation in marine species and unveil stronger spatial signal than SNPs. Our study provides the means to study CNVs in non-model species and underlines the importance to consider structural variants alongside SNPs to enhance our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes shaping adaptive population structure.},

Here, we provide evidence that the role of the hydrophobic ligand binding of odorant binding proteins (OBPs) extends beyond their typical function in the olfactory system to support insect flight activity vi.a lipid‐interactions. Transcriptomic and candidate gene analyses show that two phylogenetically clustered OBPs (OBP3/OBP6) are consistently over‐expressed in adult moths of the migrant Old‐World bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera , displaying sustained flight performance in flight activity bioassays. Tissue‐specific over‐expression of OBP6 was observed in the antennae, head and thorax in long‐fliers of H. armigera. Transgenic Drosophila flies over‐expressing a H. armigera transcript of OBP6 (HarmOBP6) in the flight muscle attained higher flight speeds on a modified tethered flight system. Quantification of lipid molecules using mass‐spectrometry showed a depletion of triacylglyerol and phospholipids in flown moths. Protein homology models built from the crystal structure of a fatty acid carrier protein identified the binding site of OBP3 and OBP6 for hydrophobic ligand binding with both proteins exhibiting a stronger average binding affinity with TAG and phospholipids compared with other groups of ligands. We propose that HarmOBP3 and HarmOBP6 contribute to the flight capacity of a globally invasive and highly migratory noctuid moth, and in doing so, extend the function of this group of proteins beyond their typical role as chemosensory proteins in insects.},

In the late summer and autumn, summer-generation dragonflies migrate to the south. Their wintering places remain unknown. Stable hydrogen (δ2H) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope analyses were conducted to confirm the migration of S. fonscolombii and determine the wintering area. Stable isotope composition of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in wings and legs was used to clarify the habitats in which dragonfly development took place. Three cohorts of dragonflies collected in different regions of Middle Asia were used for analysis: (i) immigrants that arrived in the spring, (ii) residents that developed in Middle Asia, and (iii) transit dragonflies migrating to the south during autumn. The average δ2H values in the wings were significantly higher in immigrants (−96‰) than in residents (−134‰) and transit individuals (−124‰). High δ18O and δ15N values in the tissue of immigrants confirmed their southerly origin. Based on the species range and the global distribution of annual averages of δ2H and δ18O values in precipitation, the latitudinal migrations of S. fonscolombii were inferred to cover the area from the proposed natal regions of immigrants in South-West Asia (below ∼36°N) to Southern Ural and the south of Western Siberia in the north (54–55°N) with a maximum migration distance of more than 4000 km.},

Here I examine fecal cortisol concentrations as a hormonal measure of stress to assess the relative well-being of Lemur catta in groups of different size and in seasons of normal and low tamarind fruit availability. I test the hypotheses that there is an optimal group size at which cortisol is lowest and that optimal group size changes in food-scarce conditions. I collected 799 fecal samples from 87 individuals in seven free-ranging L. catta groups at Berenty Reserve, Madagascar, over a 1-year period (August 1999-July 2000) and determined fecal cortisol concentrations using a radioimmunoassay. Expressing these as residuals from monthly population means to control for temporal fluctuations in cortisol concentration, I calculated mean fecal cortisol levels for each animal in seasons of normal and low tamarind fruit abundance and over the entire year. Overall, females exhibited lowest mean cortisol levels in groups of intermediate size, suggesting that there are benefits to maintaining membership in these groups. Females in groups that were atypically large or small for their habitat type had higher mean cortisol levels than typical groups. Cortisol levels increased in food-scarce conditions for larger groups, suggesting that intergroup competitive advantages do not outweigh intragroup feeding competition at this time. Group size may be optimized for long-term average conditions, and short-term stresses may intermittently alter the costs associated with group size. © The Author 2005.

	abstract = {Group size is a fundamental aspect of the adaptation of a social animal to its environment. There have thus been numerous attempts to infer optimal group sizes based on both empirical studies of specific taxa and theoretical models that aim to establish generalities. One such generality is that larger groups experience greater within-group foraging competition because of either direct interference by other group members or the rapid exploitation of resources. The ecological constraints hypothesis proposes that increases in group size will increase intragroup feeding competition, thus forcing individuals to visit more patches and to cover greater areas than they would in smaller groups. This paper provides a simple formal model of this constraint, suggesting that two types of constraint limit group sizes in this scenario. First, a constraint on time available to reach an energetic threshold may limit groups to sizes that allow each individual forager to attain that threshold. Second, the balance of foraging costs to benefits may curtail group size even in the absence of a temporal constraint. Both these constraints can be obviated by the adoption of fission-fusion social systems in which a group divides into subgroups during foraging. This latter finding is discussed in relation to primate social systems with an emphasis on time budget approaches. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {Northern bobwhite, Colinus virginianus, form social units, called coveys, during the nonbreeding season (approximately September-April). Because the evolutionary advantage of this behaviour is generally unknown, we used controlled group size manipulations within an aviary to investigate whether group size influences (1) the time that the covey spends feeding, (2) the percentage of the covey that is vigilant, (3) the overall vigilance of the group and (4) the time to predator detection. We found that increasing group size increased the time that coveys spent in an exposed feeding area, reduced individual vigilance, improved group vigilance and decreased the time to detection of a potential predator. Additionally, we used experimental reductions of wild northern bobwhite coveys to test whether groups size influences (1) individual and covey survival, (2) daily movement in maintaining covey size and (3) mass change. We conducted field research on 12 independent 259-ha study areas (6 control plots and 6 treatments, where 60\% of the population was removed) in east-central Kansas, U.S.A. between 9 November and 31 January, 1997-2000. We radio-marked 386 radiocollared individuals that comprised 137 groups on the study areas. Covey size did not differ between or within years or treatments (X̄ ± SE: 10.98 ± 0.22 individuals). Our results indicate that a stable group size existed between 1 and 22 individuals, with 11 being an optimal group size. Small coveys (1-7 individuals) had lower group persistence and individual survival, and used increased movement to create or join larger groups where survival was higher. Large groups (15-22) had lower individual survival, increased group movement and individual mass loss. Density-dependent feedbacks (e.g. lower survival and increased competition) may have lowered larger coveys to a stable size. Our results suggest the regulation of an optimal covey size of 11 was promoted by high group persistence, low group movement, improved feeding efficiency, improved individual predator detection and improved individual survival. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Per capita reproductive success reached a maximum at 3-6 females on the open grass plains of the Serengeti and at 3-11 females in the woodlands. Approximately 50\% of female cohorts dispersed when potential pride size exceeded the habitat-specific optimum, whereas only 9\% of cohorts dispersed at smaller pride sizes. Cohorts of one to two females rarely dispersed, especially in high-density habitats. Thus, pride size typically remained within the range that maximized individual reproductive success. In the high-density woodland habitat, females were less likely to disperse from prides that were surrounded by large numbers of unrelated females, as would be predicted on the basis of habitat saturation. However, the number of unrelated neighbours did not affect dispersal decisions of females living in the sparsely occupied plains habitat. After pride fission, daughters settled closer to their mothers in areas where there were greater numbers of unrelated female neighbours, but territories were just as exclusive as between unrelated neighbouring prides. Maternal prides in high-quality areas shared a greater percentage of their territory with descendant prides, but this tolerance diminished as relatedness declined through time. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

However, none of the candidate compounds reported5–7 meet all the criteria for a locust aggregation pheromone. Here, using behavioural assays, electrophysiological recording, olfactory receptor characterization and field experiments, we demonstrate that 4-vinylanisole (4VA) (also known as 4-methoxystyrene) is an aggregation pheromone of the migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). Both gregarious and solitary locusts are strongly attracted to 4VA, regardless of age and sex. Although it is emitted specifically by gregarious locusts, 4VA production can be triggered by aggregation of four to five solitary locusts. It elicits responses specifically from basiconic sensilla on locust antennae. We also identified OR35 as a specific olfactory receptor of 4VA. Knockout of OR35 using CRISPR–Cas9 markedly reduced the electrophysiological responses of the antennae and impaired 4VA behavioural attractiveness. Finally, field trapping experiments verified the attractiveness of 4VA to experimental and wild populations. These findings identify a locust aggregation pheromone and provide insights for the development of novel control strategies for locusts.},

	abstract = {Background: Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa zea are major caterpillar pests of Old and New World agriculture, respectively. Both, particularly H. armigera, are extremely polyphagous, and H. armigera has developed resistance to many insecticides. Here we use comparative genomics, transcriptomics and resequencing to elucidate the genetic basis for their properties as pests. Results: We find that, prior to their divergence about 1.5 Mya, the H. armigera/H. zea lineage had accumulated up to more than 100 more members of specific detoxification and digestion gene families and more than 100 extra gustatory receptor genes, compared to other lepidopterans with narrower host ranges. The two genomes remain very similar in gene content and order, but H. armigera is more polymorphic overall, and H. zea has lost several detoxification genes, as well as about 50 gustatory receptor genes. It also lacks certain genes and alleles conferring insecticide resistance found in H. armigera. Non-synonymous sites in the expanded gene families above are rapidly diverging, both between paralogues and between orthologues in the two species. Whole genome transcriptomic analyses of H. armigera larvae show widely divergent responses to different host plants, including responses among many of the duplicated detoxification and digestion genes. Conclusions: The extreme polyphagy of the two heliothines is associated with extensive amplification and neofunctionalisation of genes involved in host finding and use, coupled with versatile transcriptional responses on different hosts. H. armigera's invasion of the Americas in recent years means that hybridisation could generate populations that are both locally adapted and insecticide resistant.},

In the field-collected larvae and adults of Oryctes nasicornis (Scarabaeidae) and Uloma rufa (Tenebrionidae), the range of δ13C and δ15N values for different body parts and organs (muscles, legs, wings, elytra, fat body, gonads, etc.) was 4.8‰ and 2.4‰, respectively.

The isotopic composition of nitrogen in beetles did not depend on the ontogenetic stage and was not affected by metamorphosis. In larvae and adults of Tribolium confusum (Tenebrionidae) reared in the laboratory culture, the trophic fractionation factors of carbon (Δ13C) and nitrogen (Δ15N) were within the expected values (from −1 to 1.5‰ and from 3 to 5‰, respectively), though depended on the diet.

	abstract = {Summary: The nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) isotope ratios of animal tissues can help identify the composition of diets and open up a myriad of ecological applications. However, consumers do not ingest or assimilate all components of food items, and it is not well understood how sampling different tissues of sources and consumers may affect isotopic values ascribed, and thereby how such variation affects derived ecological measures. Utilizing a simple prey-predator feeding relationship in insects, we examined isotopic differences in soft, exoskeleton and whole tissues using samples with and without lipid extraction. As a derived ecological measure, we calculated trophic discrimination factors, changes in δ15N or δ13C between source and consumer, for the different prey-predator tissue combinations. Lipid extraction did not affect δ15N values, and we found significant tissue differences in δ15N that varied between prey and predator. Lipid extraction enriched δ13C values in most instances, and it was only after extraction of lipids that we observed consistent depletion of δ13C in exoskeleton relative to soft tissues in prey and predator. Isotopic differences between tissue types propagated marked variation in derived ecological parameters. Common sampling practice using whole tissue for prey and predator (whole/whole) resulted in a trophic discrimination factor of 0·48‰ for δ15N, compared with correct factors of 0·97‰ (soft/whole) and 2·18‰ (soft/soft) using prey soft tissue actually ingested by the predator. For δ13C, variation across discrimination factors was less, with whole/whole tissue of -0·14‰, whilst correct factors were -0·55‰ (soft/whole) and -0·04‰ (soft/soft). Our results indicate that tissue selection and preparation are important considerations for isotopic studies using arthropods. Lipid extraction is necessary to derive accurate δ13C values based on proteins, whilst consequences of tissue selection are likely context-dependent: In poorly defined systems where sources are isotopically similar or have larger variance, our results indicate that tissue selection within sources is important to avoid significant error, whether estimating trophic positions or dietary proportions using mixing models. In such cases, we strongly recommend exclusion of source materials not assimilated in consumers. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are suffering a major decline due to the environmental constraints imposed by climate change. Over the last 20 years, three major coral bleaching events occurred in concomitance with anomalous heatwaves, provoking a severe loss of coral cover worldwide. The conservation strategies for preserving reefs, as they are implemented now, cannot cope with global climatic shifts. Consequently, researchers are advocating for preservation networks to be set-up to reinforce coral adaptive potential. However, the main obstacle to this implementation is that studies on coral adaption are usually hard to generalize at the scale of a reef system. Here, we study the relationships between genotype frequencies and environmental characteristics of the sea (seascape genomics), in combination with connectivity analysis, to investigate the adaptive potential of a flagship coral species of the Ryukyu Archipelago (Japan). By associating genotype frequencies with descriptors of historical environmental conditions, we discovered six genomic regions hosting polymorphisms that might promote resistance against heat stress. Remarkably, annotations of genes in these regions were consistent with molecular roles associated with heat responses. Furthermore, we combined information on genetic and spatial distances between reefs to predict connectivity at a regional scale. The combination of these results portrayed the adaptive potential of this population: we were able to identify reefs carrying potential heat stress adapted genotypes and to understand how they disperse to neighbouring reefs. This information was summarized by objective, quantifiable and mappable indices covering the whole region, which can be extremely useful for future prioritization of reefs in conservation planning. This framework is transferable to any coral species on any reef system and therefore represents a valuable tool for empowering preservation efforts dedicated to the protection of coral reefs in warming oceans.},

Furthermore, structural variation as chromosomal rearrangements may facilitate adaptation despite high gene flow. However, our understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms impending or favouring local adaptation in the presence of gene flow is still limited to a restricted number of study systems. In this study, we examined how demographic history, shared ancestral polymorphism, and gene flow among glacial lineages contribute to local adaptation to sea conditions in a marine fish, the capelin (Mallotus villosus). We first assembled a 490-Mbp draft genome of M. villosus to map our RAD sequence reads. Then, we used a large data set of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (25,904 filtered SNPs) genotyped in 1,310 individuals collected from 31 spawning sites in the northwest Atlantic. We reconstructed the history of divergence among three glacial lineages and showed that they probably diverged from 3.8 to 1.8 million years ago and experienced secondary contacts. Within each lineage, our analyses provided evidence for large Ne and high gene flow among spawning sites. Within the Northwest Atlantic lineage, we detected a polymorphic chromosomal rearrangement leading to the occurrence of three haplogroups. Genotype–environment associations revealed molecular signatures of local adaptation to environmental conditions prevailing at spawning sites. Our study also suggests that both shared polymorphisms among lineages, resulting from standing genetic variation or introgression, and chromosomal rearrangements may contribute to local adaptation in the presence of high gene flow.},

	abstract = {Using mixed-species bird flocks as an example, we model the payoffs for two types of species from participating in multi-species animal groups. Salliers feed on mobile prey, are good sentinels and do not affect prey capture rates of gleaners; gleaners feed on prey on substrates and can enhance the prey capture rate of salliers by flushing prey, but are poor sentinels. These functional types are known from various animal taxa that form multi-species associations. We model costs and benefits of joining groups for a wide range of group compositions under varying abundances of two types of prey-prey on substrates and mobile prey. Our model predicts that gleaners and salliers show a conflict of interest in multi-species groups, because gleaners benefit from increasing numbers of salliers in the group, whereas salliers benefit from increasing gleaner numbers. The model also predicts that the limits to size and variability in composition of multi-species groups are driven by the relative abundance of different types of prey, independent of predation pressure. Our model emphasises resources as a primary driver of temporal and spatial group dynamics, rather than reproductive activity or predation per se, which have hitherto been thought to explain patterns of multi-species group formation and cohesion. The qualitative predictions of the model are supported by empirical patterns from both terrestrial and marine multi-species groups, suggesting that similar mechanisms might underlie group dynamics in a range of taxa. The model also makes novel predictions about group dynamics that can be tested using variation across space and time. © 2012 Srinivasan, Quader.},

Genomic islands may contain functional variants involved in local adaptation or reproductive isolation and may therefore play an important role in the speciation process. However, genomic islands can also arise through evolutionary processes unrelated to speciation, and examination of their properties can illuminate how new species evolve. Here, we performed scans for regions of high relative divergence (FST) in 12 species pairs of Darwin's finches at different genetic distances. In each pair, we identify genomic islands that are, on average, elevated in both relative divergence (FST) and absolute divergence (dXY). This signal indicates that haplotypes within these genomic regions became isolated from each other earlier than the rest of the genome. Interestingly, similar numbers of genomic islands of elevated dXY are observed in sympatric and allopatric species pairs, suggesting that recent gene flow is not a major factor in their formation. We find that two of the most pronounced genomic islands contain the ALX1 and HMGA2 loci, which are associated with variation in beak shape and size, respectively, suggesting that they are involved in ecological adaptation. A subset of genomic island regions, including these loci, appears to represent anciently diverged haplotypes that evolved early during the radiation of Darwin's finches. Comparative genomics data indicate that these loci, and genomic islands in general, have exceptionally low recombination rates, which may play a role in their establishment.},

Recent studies have documented highly heterogeneous differentiation landscapes, with distinct regions of elevated differentiation ("differentiation islands") widespread across genomes. However, it remains unclear which processes drive the evolution of differentiation islands; how the differentiation landscape evolves as speciation advances; and ultimately, how differentiation islands are related to speciation. Here, we addressed these questions based on population genetic analyses of 200 resequenced genomes from 10 populations of four Ficedula flycatcher sister species. We show that a heterogeneous differentiation landscape starts emerging among populations within species, and differentiation islands evolve recurrently in the very same genomic regions among independent lineages. Contrary to expectations from models that interpret differentiation islands as genomic regions involved in reproductive isolation that are shielded from gene flow, patterns of sequence divergence (dxy and relative node depth) do not support a major role of gene flow in the evolution of the differentiation landscape in these species. Instead, as predicted by models of linked selection, genome-wide variation in diversity and differentiation can be explained by variation in recombination rate and the density of targets for selection. We thus conclude that the heterogeneous landscape of differentiation in Ficedula flycatchers evolves mainly as the result of background selection and selective sweeps in genomic regions of low recombination. Our results emphasize the necessity of incorporating linked selection as a null model to identify genome regions involved in adaptation and speciation.},

We investigated patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation in stonechats (genus Saxicola), a widely distributed avian species complex with phenotypic variation in plumage, morphology and migratory behaviour, to ask whether similar genomic regions have become differentiated in independent, but closely related, taxa. We used whole-genome pooled sequencing of 262 individuals from five taxa and found that levels of genetic diversity and divergence are strongly correlated among different stonechat taxa. We then asked whether these patterns remain correlated at deeper evolutionary scales and found that homologous genomic regions have become differentiated in stonechats and the closely related Ficedula flycatchers. Such correlation across a range of evolutionary divergence and among phylogenetically independent comparisons suggests that similar processes may be driving the differentiation of these independently evolving lineages, which in turn may be the result of intrinsic properties of particular genomic regions (e.g. areas of low recombination). Consequently, studies employing genome scans to search for areas important for reproductive isolation or adaptation should account for corresponding regions of differentiation, as these regions may not necessarily represent speciation islands or evidence of local adaptation.},

Using next-generation sequencing of restriction-site-associated DNA (RAD) tags, we genotyped thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two wild populations of migratory steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from the Pacific Northwest of the United States. One population maintains a connection to the sea, whereas the other population has been sequestered from its access to the ocean for more than 50 years by a hydropower dam. Here we performed a genome-wide association study to identify 504 RAD SNP markers from several genetic regions that were associated with the propensity to migrate both within and between the populations. Our results corroborate those in previous quantitative trait loci studies and provide evidence for additional loci associated with this complex migratory life history. Our results suggest a complex multi-genic basis with several loci of small effect distributed throughout the genome contributing to migration in this species. We also determined that despite being sequestered for decades, the landlocked population continues to harbour genetic variation associated with a migratory life history and ATPase activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of genotyping-by-sequencing and how RAD-tag SNP data can be readily compared between studies to investigate migration within this species. © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The unit of adaptation is usually thought to be a gene or set of interacting genes, rather than the whole genome, and this may be true of species differentiation. Defining species on the basis of reproductive isolation (RI), on the other hand, is a concept best applied to the entire genome. The biological species concept (BSC; Mayr, 1963) stresses the isolation aspect of speciation on the basis of two fundamental genetic assumptions - the number of loci underlying species differentiation is large and the whole genome behaves as a cohesive, or coadapted genetic unit. Under these tenets, the exchange of any part of the genomes between diverging groups is thought to destroy their integrity. Hence, the maintenance of each species' genome cohesiveness by isolating mechanisms has become the central concept of species. In contrast, the Darwinian view of speciation is about differential adaptation to different natural or sexual environments. RI is viewed as an important by product of differential adaptation and complete RI across the whole genome need not be considered as the most central criterion of speciation. The emphasis on natural and sexual selection thus makes the Darwinian view compatible with the modern genic concept of evolution. Genetic and molecular analyses of speciation in the last decade have yielded surprisingly strong support for the neo-Darwinian view of extensive genetic differentiation and epistasis during speciation. However, the extent falls short of what BSC requires in order to achieve whole-genome 'cohesiveness'. Empirical observations suggest that the gene is the unit of species differentiation. Significantly, the genetic architecture underlying RI, the patterns of species hybridization and the molecular signature of speciation genes all appear to support the view that RI is one of the manifestations of differential adaptation, as Darwin (1859, Chap. 8) suggested. The nature of this adaptation may be as much the result of sexual selection as natural selection. In the light of studies since its early days, BSC may now need a major revision by shifting the emphasis from isolation at the level of whole genome to differential adaptation at the genic level. With this revision, BSC would in fact be close to Darwin's original concept of speciation.},

Based on patterns emerging from recent research on the evolution of differentiation across the speciation continuum, I illustrate how long-term linked selection affects the distribution of differentiation along genomes.

	abstract = {Monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), larvae were collected during August 1983 from the common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca L., across its extensive North American range from North Dakota, east to Vermont, and south to Virginia. This confirms that the late summer distribution of breeding monarchs in eastern North America coincides with the range of this extremely abundant milkweed resource. Plant cardenolide concentrations, assayed by spectrophotometry in 158 samples from 27 collection sites, were biased towards plants with low cardenolide, and ranged from 4 to 229 μg/ 0.1 g dry weight, with a mean of 50 μg/0.1 g. Monarch larvae reared on these plants stored cardenolides logarithmically, and produced 158 adults with a normally distributed concentration range from 0 to 792 μg/0. l g dry butterfly, with a mean of 234 μg/0.1 g. Thus butterflies increased the mean plant cardenolide concentration by 4.7. The eastern plants and their resultant butterflies had higher cardenolide concentrations than those from the west, and in some areas monarchs sequestered more cardenolide from equivalent plants. Plants growing in small patches had higher cardenolide concentrations than those in larger patches, but this did not influence butterfly concentration. However, younger plants and those at habitat edges had higher cardenolide concentrations than either older, shaded, or open habitat plants, and this did influence butterfly storage. There were no apparent topographical differences reflected in the cardenolides of plants and butterflies. Twenty-eight cardenolides were recognized by thin-layer chromatography, with 27 in plants and 21 in butterflies. Butterflies stored cardenolides within the more polar 46\% of the plant Rd range, these being sequestered in higher relative concentrations than they occurred in the plants. By comparison with published TLC cardenolide mobilities, spots 3, 4, 9, 16, 24 or 25, 26, and 27, may be the cardenolides syrioside, uzarin, syriobioside, syriogenin, uzarigenin, labriformidin, and labriformin, respectively. Cochromatography with cardenolide standards indicated that desglucosyrioside did not occur in the plants but did occur in 70\% of the butterflies, and aspecioside was in 99\% of the plants and 100\% of the butterflies. The polar aspecioside was the single most concentrated and diagnostic cardenolide in both plants and butterflies. Butterfly Rd values were dependent on those of the plant, and both showed remarkable uniformity over the range of areas sampled. Thus contrary to previous reports, A. syriaca has a biogeographically consistent cardenolide fingerprint pattern. The ecological implications of this for understanding the monarch's annual migration cycle are significant. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

To test this, we related map-based metrics of migratory diversity to recent population trends for 340 European breeding birds. Species that occupy larger non-breeding ranges relative to breeding, a characteristic we term 'migratory dispersion', were less likely to be declining than those with more restricted non-breeding ranges. Species with partial migration strategies (i.e. overlapping breeding and non-breeding ranges) were also less likely to be declining than full migrants or full residents, an effect that was independent of migration distance. Recent rates of advancement in Europe-wide spring arrival date were greater for partial migrants than full migrants, suggesting that migratory diversity may also help facilitate species responses to climate change.},

	abstract = {Understanding how breeding populations are spatially and temporarily associated with one another over the annual cycle has important implications for population dynamics. Migratory connectivity typically assumes that populations mix randomly; yet, in many species and populations, sex-, age-or other subgroups migrate separately, and/or spend the non-breeding period separated from each other- A phenomenon coined differential migration. These subgroups likely experience varying environmental conditions, which may carry-over to affect body condition, reproductive success and survival. We argue that environmental or habitat changes can have disproportional effects on a population's demographic rates under differential migration compared to random mixing. Depending on the relative contribution of each of these subgroups to population growth, environmental perturbations may be buffered (under-proportional) or amplified (over-proportional). Thus, differential migration may result in differential mortality and carry-over effects that can have concomitant consequences for dynamics and resilience of the populations. Recognizing the role of differential migration in migratory connectivity and its consequences on population dynamics can assist in developing conservation actions that are tailored to the most influential demographic group(s) and the times and places where they are at peril.},

	abstract = {Animal movement comes in a variety of 'types' including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding 'typical' movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species' ability to respond to future environmental change.},

	abstract = {Migration strategies differ greatly among and within avian populations. The associated trade-offs and fitness consequences of diverse strategies and how they persist are pertinent questions in migration research. Migration is a costly endeavour, presumably compensated for by better survival conditions in the non-breeding area. One way to assess the cost of alternative strategies is to investigate the investment in movement across the entire annual cycle, an assessment made increasingly feasible with improvements in tracking technology. Our study focuses on lesser black-backed gulls, generalist seabirds that exploit a broad range of resources, exhibit diverse migration strategies and have potentially altered migration strategies in response to human activities and climate change. We used GPS tracking to quantify lesser black-backed gulls’ movement throughout their annual cycle and compare trade-offs among four migration strategies. The annual cumulative distance travelled by long distance migrants wintering in west Africa, over 4000 km from their breeding colony, did not differ significantly from individuals of the same breeding colony wintering only a few hundred kilometres away in Great Britain. Short distance migrants returned to the colony first, and long distance migrants returned last. Sex and wing length were not correlated with maximum range, cumulative distance travelled or timing. Individuals spent only a small proportion of their time in flight and spent on average 17\% of their time at sea throughout an annual cycle, suggesting a reliance on inland resources for many individuals. Analysing movement throughout the annual cycle can change our perspective and understanding of consequences of different migration strategies. Our study shows that a range of migration strategies coexists and we propose that the long term costs and benefits of these strategies balance out. Diversity in migration strategies may contribute to the resilience of this species in the face of ongoing anthropogenic impact on the environment.},

	abstract = {Population genetic studies provide insights into the evolutionary processes that influence the distribution of sequence variants within and among wild populations. FST is among the most widely used measures for genetic differentiation and plays a central role in ecological and evolutionary genetic studies. It is commonly thought that large sample sizes are required in order to precisely infer FST and that small sample sizes lead to overestimation of genetic differentiation. Until recently, studies in ecological model organisms incorporated a limited number of genetic markers, but since the emergence of next generation sequencing, the panel size of genetic markers available even in non-reference organisms has rapidly increased. In this study we examine whether a large number of genetic markers can substitute for small sample sizes when estimating FST. We tested the behavior of three different estimators that infer FST and that are commonly used in population genetic studies. By simulating populations, we assessed the effects of sample size and the number of markers on the various estimates of genetic differentiation. Furthermore, we tested the effect of ascertainment bias on these estimates. We show that the population sample size can be significantly reduced (as small as n = 4-6) when using an appropriate estimator and a large number of bi-allelic genetic markers (k{\textgreater}1,000). Therefore, conservation genetic studies can now obtain almost the same statistical power as studies performed on model organisms using markers developed with next-generation sequencing. © 2012 Willing et al.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10-20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. © 2009 The Author(s).},

Most of them are very efficient for short reads but inefficient or not applicable for reads {\textgreater}200 bp because the algorithms are heavily and specifically tuned for short queries with low sequencing error rate. However, some sequencing platforms already produce longer reads and others are expected to become available soon. For longer reads, hashingbased software such as BLAT and SSAHA2 remain the only choices. Nonetheless, these methods are substantially slower than short-read aligners in terms of aligned bases per unit time.

Specifically, whole-exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies is gaining popularity in the human genetics community due to the moderate costs, manageable data amounts and straightforward interpretation of analysis results. While whole-exome and, in the near future, whole-genome sequencing are becoming commodities, data analysis still poses significant challenges and led to the development of a plethora of tools supporting specific parts of the analysis workflow or providing a complete solution. Here, we surveyed 205 tools for whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing data analysis supporting five distinct analytical steps: quality assessment, alignment, variant identification, variant annotation and visualization.We report an overview of the functionality, features and specific requirements of the individual tools. We then selected 32 programs for variant identification, variant annotation and visualization, which were subjected to hands-on evaluation using four data sets: one set of exome data from two patients with a rare disease for testing identification of germline mutations, two cancer data sets for testing variant callers for somatic mutations, copy number variations and structural variations, and one semi-synthetic data set for testing identification of copy number variations.Our comprehensive survey and evaluation of NGS tools provides a valuable guideline for human geneticists working on Mendelian disorders, complex diseases and cancers. © The Author 2013.

	abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies. © 2009 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

The kernels of our algorithms are written in C/C++ and highly optimized. Benchmarks show the uniprocessor implementations of PCA and identity-by-descent are ∼8-50 times faster than the implementations provided in the popular EIGENSTRAT (v3.0) and PLINK (v1.07) programs, respectively, and can be sped up to 30-300-fold by using eight cores.

As experience grows, researchers increasingly recognize that analyzing the wealth of data provided by these new sequencing platforms requires careful attention to detail for robust results. Thus far, much of the scientific Communit's focus for use in bacterial genomics has been on evaluating genome assembly algorithms and rigorously validating assembly program performance. Missing, however, is a focus on critical evaluation of variant callers for these genomes. Variant calling is essential for comparative genomics as it yields insights into nucleotide-level organismal differences. Variant calling is a multistep process with a host of potential error sources that may lead to incorrect variant calls. Identifying and resolving these incorrect calls is critical for bacterial genomics to advance. The goal of this review is to provide guidance on validating algorithms and pipelines used in variant calling for bacterial genomics. First, we will provide an overview of the variant calling procedures and the potential sources of error associated with the methods. We will then identify appropriate datasets for use in evaluating algorithms and describe statistical methods for evaluating algorithm performance. As variant calling moves from basic research to the applied setting, standardized methods for performance evaluation and reporting are required; it is our hope that this review provides the groundwork for the development of these standards.},

Much of our knowledge of insect epigenetics has been gleaned from a few model species. However, more studies of epigenetic information in traditionally nonmodel taxa will help advance our understanding of the developmental and evolutionary significance of epigenetic inheritance in insects. To this end, we also provide a brief overview of techniques for profiling and perturbing individual facets of the epigenome. Doing so in diverse cellular, developmental, and taxonomic contexts will collectively help shed new light on how genome regulation results in the generation of diversity in insect form and function.},

	abstract = {Biologists have long been interested in the factors that maintain variation in learning and plasticity within and between species, especially given the role of such flexibility in coping with novel and changing environments. A large body of theoretical and empirical work has established the role of environmental variation in selecting for learning and plasticity, suggesting that simple measures of such variation could serve as proxies for organismal flexibility. However, a wide range of behavioural and physiological traits can shape how organisms experience environmental variation, and thus how plasticity is shaped by selection. Given that these traits themselves can evolve, this sets up the potential for complex feedbacks in the evolution of learning and plasticity. We begin this review by first detailing the wide variety of behavioural traits that shape environmental variation, ranging from exploration and dispersal to sensory biases and habitat choice. We then review relevant theory that suggests how such behavioural traits can modify selection on learning and plasticity, often favouring the evolution of specialization in heterogeneous environments by reducing the variation that organisms experience. When models allow behavioural traits to jointly evolve with plasticity, model outcomes differ and complex evolutionary feedbacks may emerge. We suggest that further theoretical insights could be gained by incorporating more nuances of development and behaviour, such as variation in the developmental window of environmental sensitivity of traits or differences in exploratory periods prior to breeding. Finally, this review discusses implications of this perspective for understanding the maintenance of genetic variation in learning, differences in colonization and survival in novel environments and making predictions about how species will cope with environmental change.},

	abstract = {I outline how understanding the mechanism of behavioural plasticity is important for predicting how organisms will respond to rapidly changing and novel environments. I define two major forms of behavioural plasticity: developmental and activational. Developmental plasticity refers to the capacity of a genotype to adopt different developmental trajectories in different environments. Activational plasticity refers to differential activation of an underlying network in different environments such that an individual expresses various phenotypes throughout their lifetime. I suggest that the costs and benefits of these two forms of behavioural plasticity may differ: developmental plasticity is slow, but results in a wider range of more integrated responses. Furthermore, the neural costs associated with activational plasticity may be greater because large neural networks must be maintained past an initial sampling and learning phase. While the benefits of plasticity are realized in variable environments, I argue that fine-grained and coarse-grained variation may differentially select for activational and developmental plasticity, respectively. Because environmental variation experienced by an organism is largely determined by behaviour, developmental plasticity may still evolve in fine-grained environments if niche choice results in coarse-grained 'realized' variation. Behavioural plasticity should impact evolution in novel environments because it increases the chances of survival in these environments. Developmental behavioural plasticity may be particularly important for diversification in novel environments because it can impact not only survival, but also the development of signals and preferences important in mate choice. Future areas of research on behavioural plasticity and rapid environmental change include stress as a mechanism underlying rapid integrated responses and life history perspectives on predicting developmental versus evolutionary responses. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

	abstract = {Ecological processes are changing in response to climatic warming. Birds, in particular, have been documented to arrive and breed earlier in spring and this has been attributed to elevated spring temperatures. It is not clear, however, how long-distance migratory birds that overwinter thousands of kilometers to the south in the tropics cue into changes in temperature or plant phenology on northern breeding areas. We explored the relationships between the timing and rate of spring migration of long-distance migratory birds, and variables such as temperature, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and plant phenology, using mist net capture data from three ringing stations in North America over a 40-year period. Mean April/May temperatures in eastern North America varied over a 5°C range, but with no significant trend during this period. Similarly, we found few significant trends toward earlier median capture dates of birds. Median capture dates were not related to the NAO, but were inversely correlated to spring temperatures for almost all species. For every 1°C increase in spring temperature, median capture dates of migratory birds averaged, across species, one day earlier. Lilac (Syringa vulgaris) budburst, however, averaged 3 days earlier for every 1°C increase in spring temperature, suggesting that the impact of temperature on plant phenology is three times greater than on bird phenology. To address whether migratory birds adjust their rate of northward migration to changes in temperature, we compared median capture dates for 15 species between a ringing station on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana in the southern USA with two stations approximately 2,500 km to the north. The interval between median capture dates in Louisiana and at the other two ringing stations was inversely correlated with temperature, with an average interval of 22 days, that decreased by 0.8 days per 1°C increase in temperature. Our results suggest that, although the onset of migration may be determined endogenously, the timing of migration is flexible and can be adjusted in response to variation in weather and/or phenology along migration routes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

As conservation biology textbooks underpin many conservation education programs at both undergraduate and graduate levels, the portrayal of conservation issues and coverage of specific biotic groups plays a potentially important role in guiding the training of the next generation of conservation professionals. Parasites represent the majority of species diversity on earth, play critical roles in ecology and evolution, and are often at higher risk of decline and extinction than their free-living counterparts. Yet parasites continue to receive scant attention from conservation scientists and educators. We searched the index of 77 English language conservation biology textbooks for parasite or pathogen related content, published between 1970 and 2009. When present, we categorized a textbook's parasite content as positive, neutral or negative with respect to the author's portrayal of parasite biodiversity. The vast majority (72\%) of conservation textbooks either portray parasites uniquely as threats to conservation goals established for free-living species or do not mention parasites at all. While no single textbook can be expected to provide extensive treatment of conservation-related topics across all biological groups, we outline three reasons why parasites should feature more prominently in formal conservation education, and suggest several ways in which greater incorporation of these parasite topics could strengthen the teaching and practice of conservation biology. © 2010.},

However, little is known about its effect on insect flight behaviour, even though this will influence insect dispersal and distribution, and potentially migration and ecosystem services such as pollination. 2. Here we use a tethered flight mill setup to examine the behaviour of adult painted lady butterflies (Vanessa cardui L.) flying in different levels of combustion-generated airborne PM2.5, comparison this to TFM flying under ‘clean air’ conditions. 3. Descriptive statistics and paired sample t-tests indicate that the smoke had a significantly deleterious impact on flight behaviour, with for example total flight distance covered declining by 65\% during the first 20 min of flying in the least smoke contaminated air compared to ‘clean air’ control conditions, whilst average speed declined by 54\% and flight duration by 32\%. A strongly negative and highly significant linear correlation between flight speed and PM2.5 concentration was also observed. 4. This study represents the first time that smoke effects on insect flight behaviour have been experimentally tested, and the longer the butterflies were exposed to the elevated PM2.5 concentrations the more obviously their flight behaviour declined. We conclude that the month(s)-long episodes of air pollution often associated with agricultural burning and deforestation fires in the tropics may well be significantly affecting the behaviour of the flying insects living in those regions and/or who migrate through them.},

For this purpose, a beehive called the Honey Factory, located in the Triennale museum area in Milano, was considered in the trial from May to October 2015. Every two days, bees found dead in the beehive were collected and the concentration of lead, cadmium and nickel on the bees bodies were evaluated through atomic absorption analysis. In the same period, data about atmospheric dust, Lead, Cadmium and Nickel, were daily downloaded by the ARPA website. The comparison between atmospheric and animal data has revealed a tight relation. Linear regressions for animals and atmosphere were calculated: when the concentration of atmospheric lead exceeded the value of 4 ng/m3, bees ‘carried’ about 0.7 mg/kg of lead. When the lead atmospheric concentration was higher than 15 ng/m3, lead on the bee’s body was more than 0.9 mg/kg (y = 0.1006x + 0.573, R 2 = 0.98). A similar relationship was detected for Nickel. This study showed that heavy metals accumulated on honeybees depend on the atmospheric concentrations measured during the month before animal sampling and that PM 10 pollution level seems to contribute to Pb and Ni levels detected on the animals.Highlights Bees are environmental quality indicators. Pb, Ni, Cd (HM) were detected on bees and in the air. HM on bees depend on the atmospheric concentration.},

	abstract = {Honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) have great potential for detecting and monitoring environmental pollution, given their wide-ranging foraging behaviour. Previous studies have demonstrated that concentrations of metals in adult honeybees were significantly higher at polluted than at control locations. These studies focused at a limited range of heavy metals and highly contrasting locations, and sampling was rarely repeated over a prolonged period. In our study, the potential of honeybees to detect and monitor metal pollution was further explored by measuring the concentration in adult honeybees of a wide range of trace metals, nine of which were not studied before, at three locations in the Netherlands over a 3-month period. The specific objective of the study was to assess the spatial and temporal variation in concentration in adult honeybees of Al, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Li, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, Ti, V and Zn. In the period of July-September 2006, replicated samples were taken at 2-week intervals from commercial-type beehives. The metal concentration in micrograms per gram honeybee was determined by inductive coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Significant differences in concentration between sampling dates per location were found for Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn Sr, Ti and V, and significant differences in average concentration between locations were found for Co, Sr and V. The results indicate that honeybees can serve to detect temporal and spatial patterns in environmental metal concentrations, even at relatively low levels of pollution. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.},

Compared with the other trace elements, Pearson correlations show that Pb concentrations in soil and dust had the strongest relationship to corresponding values in honey bees and their products. Dust Pb was not only highly correlated to corresponding soil values (r = 0.806, p = 0.005), it was the strongest predictor of Pb concentrations in honey bees, wax, and honey (p = 0.001, 0.007, 0.017, respectively). Lead isotopic compositions (206Pb/207Pb and 208Pb/207Pb) showed that honey bees and their products from Broken Hill were nearly identical (95-98\%) to the composition of the local ore body. Samples of honey bees and their products collected from background sites adjacent to national parks in Sydney had Pb isotopic compositions (206Pb/207Pb = 1.138-1.159, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.417-2.435) corresponding to local geogenic values (206Pb/207Pb = 1.123-1.176, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.413-2.500). By contrast, honey bees and their products from Sydney metropolitan (206Pb/207Pb = 1.081-1.126, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.352-2.408) were similar to aerosols measured during the period of leaded petrol use (206Pb/207Pb = 1.067-1.148, 208Pb/207Pb = 2.341-2.410). These measurements show Pb concentrations and its isotopic compositions of honey bees, and their products can be used to trace both legacy and contemporary environmental contamination, particularly where sources are well documented. Moreover, this study demonstrates that legacy Pb emissions continue to be remobilized in dust, contaminating both food and ecological systems.},

Current conservation research focuses on diminishing species diversity, minimal viable populations, and on the successive demise of habitats and populations that leads species to extinction. In this paper we utilize the monarch butterfly's remarkable migration and overwintering biology as a paradigm of a new conservation theme: endangered phenomenon. An endangered phenomenon is a spectacular aspect of the life history of an animal or plant species involving a large number of individuals that is threatened with impover-ishment or demise; the species per se need not be in peril, rather, the phenomenon it exhibits is at stake. We envision the near future with increasing numbers of species reduced in range and so constrained in numbers that they can no longer exhibit these characteristic spectacles.},

Designing effective conservation solutions for migratory species requires knowledge of both species ecology and the socioeconomic context of their migrations. We present a framework built around the concept that migratory species act as carriers, delivering benefit flows to people throughout their annual cycle that are supported by the network of ecosystems upon which the species depend. We apply this framework to the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) migration of eastern North America by calculating their spatial subsidies. Spatial subsidies are the net ecosystem service flows throughout a species’ range and a quantitative measure of the spatial mismatch between the locations where people receive most benefits and the locations of habitats that most support the species. Results indicate cultural benefits provided by monarchs in the U.S. and Canada are subsidized by migration and overwintering habitat in Mexico. At a finer scale, throughout the monarch range, habitat in rural landscapes subsidizes urban residents. Understanding the spatial distribution of benefits derived from and ecological support provided to monarchs and other migratory species offers a promising means of understanding the costs and benefits associated with conservation across jurisdictional borders.},

Despite rising concern over the monarch butterfly’s status, no comprehensive study of the factors driving this decline has been conducted. Using partial least-squares regressions and time-series analysis, we investigated climatic and habitat-related factors influencing monarch population size from 1993 to 2014. Potential threats included climatic factors, habitat loss (milkweed and overwinter forest), disease and agricultural insecticide use (neonicotinoids). While climatic factors, principally breeding season temperature, were important determinants of annual variation in abundance, our results indicated strong negative relationships between population size and habitat loss variables, principally glyphosate use, but also weaker negative effects from the loss of overwinter forest and breeding season use of neonicotinoids. Further declines in population size because of glyphosate application are not expected. Thus, if remaining threats to habitat are mitigated we expect climate-induced stochastic variation of the eastern migratory population of monarch butterfly around a relatively stationary population size.},

	abstract = {Addressing population declines of migratory insects requires linking populations across different portions of the annual cycle and understanding the effects of variation in weather and climate on productivity, recruitment, and patterns of long-distance movement. We used stable H and C isotopes and geospatial modeling to estimate the natal origin of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in eastern North America using over 1000 monarchs collected over almost four decades at Mexican overwintering colonies. Multinomial regression was used to ascertain which climate-related factors best-predicted temporal variation in natal origin across six breeding regions. The region producing the largest proportion of overwintering monarchs was the US Midwest (mean annual proportion = 0.38; 95\% CI: 0.36–0.41) followed by the north-central (0.17; 0.14–0.18), northeast (0.15; 0.11–0.16), northwest (0.12; 0.12–0.16), southwest (0.11; 0.08–0.12), and southeast (0.08; 0.07–0.11) regions. There was no evidence of directional shifts in the relative contributions of different natal regions over time, which suggests these regions are comprising the same relative proportion of the overwintering population in recent years as in the mid-1970s. Instead, interannual variation in the proportion of monarchs from each region covaried with climate, as measured by the Southern Oscillation Index and regional-specific daily maximum temperature and precipitation, which together likely dictate larval development rates and food plant condition. Our results provide the first robust long-term analysis of predictors of the natal origins of monarchs overwintering in Mexico. Conservation efforts on the breeding grounds focused on the Midwest region will likely have the greatest benefit to eastern North American migratory monarchs, but the population will likely remain sensitive to regional and stochastic weather patterns.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes are being increasingly used in wildlife forensics as means of determining the origin and movement of animals. The heavy isotope content of precipitated water and snow (δDp, δ18O p) varies widely and systematically across the globe, providing a label that is incorporated through diet into animal tissue. As a result, these isotopes are potentially ideal tracers of geographic origin. The hydrogen and oxygen isotope tracer method has excellent potential where (1) spatial variation of precipitation isotopes exist, and (2) strong, mechanistic relationships link precipitation and isotope ratios in biological tissue. Here, we present a method for interpolation of precipitation isotope values and use it to create global basemaps of growing-season (GS) and mean annual (MA) δDp and δ18Op. The use of these maps for forensic application is demonstrated using previously published isotope data for bird feathers (δDf) in North America and Europe. The precipitation maps show that the greatest potential for applying hydrogen and oxygen isotope forensics exists in mid- to high-latitude continental regions, where strong spatial isotope gradients exist. We demonstrate that δD f/δDp relationships have significant predictive power both in North America and Europe, and show how zones of confidence for the assignment of origin can be described using these predictive relationships. Our analysis focuses on wildlife forensics, but the maps and approaches presented here will be equally applicable to criminal forensic studies involving biological materials.

Chemical measurements were made of the soil exchange pool, leaves, caterpillars, snails, and both the femurs and eggshells of breeding insectivorous migratory songbirds. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values were transferred up the food chain from the soil exchange pool to leaves, caterpillars, snails and eggshells without modification. Adult birds were the one exception; their 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values generally reflected those of lower trophic levels at each site, but were lower and more variable, probably because their strontium was derived in part from foods in tropical winter habitats where lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios are likely to predominate. Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios decreased at each successive trophic level, supporting previous suggestions that Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios can be used to identify the trophic level at which an organism is primarily feeding. The changes in Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios we measured for vegetation and insects were comparable to similar measurements made previously (but based on single samples of each organism) in an alpine ecosystem. Changes in Sr/Ca and Ba/Ca ratios between birds and their food have not previously been measured, but the values we obtained were similar to those for herbivorous and carnivorous mammals at similar trophic levels. Our results provide evidence that supports the use of Sr/Ca ratios in the determination of human paleodiets and suggests that Sr/Ca ratios may also provide a useful tool in studies of modern food webs. Furthermore, our findings suggest that 90 Sr from nuclear fallout will not bioaccumulate in forests and that changes in Sr/Ca ratios between trophic levels will need to be considered in some cases when using 87 Sr/ 86 Sr as a tracer of calcium biogeochemistry.},

However, quantitative estimates of population recruitment from different natal habitats can be difficult to assess for many species, especially those with large geographic ranges. These limitations hinder the evaluation of alternative hypotheses about the key movements and ecological interactions of migratory species. Here, we quantitatively investigated intra-population variation in the natal origins of western North American monarch butterflies Danaus plexippus using spatial analyses of stable isotope ratios and correlations with wing morphology. A map of hydrogen isotope values in western monarch butterfly wings (δ2Hm) was estimated using a transfer function that relates the δ2Hm values of monarch butterfly wing keratin to a long-term dataset of precipitation isotope (δ2Hp) values across the western United States. Isotopic analyses of 114 monarch butterfly wings collected at four California overwintering locations indicated substantial individual variation in natal origins, with most recruitment coming from broad regions along the Pacific coast, the southwestern US and the northern intermountain region. These observed patterns may partially resolve and reconcile several past hypotheses about the natal origins of western monarch butterflies, while also raising new questions. More negative δ2Hm values (associated with longer migratory distance) were significantly correlated with larger forewing sizes, consistent with expectations based on the aerodynamic and energetic costs of long-distance migration, while analyses of wing shape suggest potential differences in the movement behaviors and constraints observed in the western range, compared with previous observations in eastern North America. Taken together, the results of this study indicate substantial individual variation in the natal origins of overwintering western monarch butterflies, suggesting both local and long-distance movement to overwintering sites.},

	abstract = {Researchers will be able to use stable isotope analysis to study community structure in an efficient way, without a need for extensive calibrations, if isotopic enrichment values are consistent, or if variation in enrichment values can be predicted. In this study, we generated an experimental data set of δ15N and δ13C enrichment means for 22 terrestrial herbivorous arthropods feeding on 18 different host plants. Mean enrichments observed across a single trophic transfer (plants to herbivores) were -0.53±0.26‰ for δ13C (range: -3.47‰ to 1.89‰) and 1.88±0.37‰ for δ15N (range: -0.20‰ to 6.59‰). The mean δ13C enrichment was significantly lower than that reported in recent literature surveys, whereas the mean δ15N enrichment was not significantly different. The experimental data set provided no support for recent hypotheses advanced to explain variation in enrichment values, including the proposed roles for consumer feeding mode, development type, and diet C:N ratio. A larger data set, formed by combining our experimental data with data from the literature, did suggest possible roles for feeding mode, nitrogen recycling, herbivore life stage, and host plant type. Our results indicate that species enrichment values are variable even in this relatively narrow defined group of organisms and that our ability to predict enrichment values of terrestrial herbivorous arthropods based on physiological, ecological, or taxonomic traits is low. The primary implications are that (1) mean enrichment may have to be measured empirically for each trophic link of interest, rather than relying on estimates from a broad survey of animal taxa and (2) the advantage of using stable isotope analysis to probe animal communities that are recalcitrant to other modes of study will be somewhat diminished as a consequence. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

	abstract = {1. Tracking insect migration at continental scales is intractable using exogenous markers because of tiny body size and high improbability of recapture. Naturally occurring endogenous isotopic markers, such as tissue d2H and d18O, are a means of assigning origins to both vertebrate and invertebrate populations, but the success depends upon derivation of a robust algorithm linking measured tissue isotope values with large-scale geospatial isotopic patterns (isoscapes) in the terrestrial hydrosphere. 2. We derived a North American dragonfly wing d2H and d18O isoscape from known-origin dragonflies of three species (Aeshna interrupta, Aeshna umbrosa and Pachydiplax longipennis) obtained across North America. A strong relationship (r2 = 0.75) was found between wing d2H and hydrologic geospatial d2H patterns, and between wing d2H and d18O (r2 = 0.92). The strong coupling between emergent insect tissue and hydrologic spatial patterning suggested that this dragonfly isoscape may be applicable to other aquatic emergent migratory insects in North America and elsewhere. 3. As a proof of concept, we used the wing isoscape algorithm to map the probability of natal origin of Common Green Darners (Anax junius) migrating through southern Texas. Results showed that these Texan dragonflies were a mix of local and far-distant migrant (e.g. northern United States) individuals. We suggest that this isoscape algorithm opens new opportunities to quantify the migration and natal origins of dragonflies and other aquatic emergent insects where conventional methods have failed},

With high capture and bycatch rates, the abundance of many species is rapidly declining and around a quarter of the world's sharks and rays are threatened with extinction. At a regional scale this negative trend has also been evidenced in the central Mediterranean Sea, where bottom-trawl fisheries have affected the biomass of certain rays (e.g. Raja clavata) and sharks (e.g. Mustelus spp.). Detailed knowledge of elasmobranch habitat requirements is essential for biodiversity conservation and fisheries management, but this is often hampered by a poor understanding of their spatial ecology. Habitat suitability models were used to investigate the habitat preference of nine elasmobranch species and their overall diversity (number of species) in relation to five environmental predictors (i.e. depth, sea surface temperature, surface salinity, slope and rugosity) in the central Mediterranean Sea. Results showed that depth, seafloor morphology and sea surface temperature were the main drivers for elasmobranch habitat suitability. Predictive distribution maps revealed different species-specific patterns of suitable habitat while high assemblage diversity was predicted in deeper offshore waters (400-800 m depth). This study helps to identify priority conservation areas and diversity hot-spots for rare and endangered elasmobranchs in the Mediterranean Sea.},

Here, we show that the highly aerial common swift Apus apus, spending the nonbreeding period on the wing, instead exhibits a rarely found chain migration pattern, where the most southern breeding populations in Europe migrate to wintering areas furthest to the south in Africa, whereas the northern populations winter to the north. The swifts concentrated in three major areas in sub-Saharan Africa during the nonbreeding period, with substantial overlap of nearby breeding populations. We found that the southern breeding swifts were larger, raised more young, and arrived to the wintering areas with higher seasonal variation in greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) earlier than the northern breeding swifts. This unusual chain migration pattern in common swifts is largely driven by differential annual timing and we suggest it evolves by prior occupancy and dominance by size in the breeding quarters and by prior occupancy combined with diffuse competition in the winter.},

Furthermore, such landmark configurations can easily be compared within and between species using a variety of analyses that together comprise the field of geometric morphometrics (Zelditch et al. 2004). The theoretical core of geometric morphometrics has been well described and is easy to understand, and as such geometric morphometrics can easily be implemented in a wide variety of research fields, such as evolutionary ecology (Zelditch et al. 2004). Using the speckled wood butterfly Pararge aegeria (L.)

In this study, we investigated for the first time the population structure at a continental scale of two migratory species of hoverflies providing both pest regulation and pollination services [Episyrphus balteatus and Sphaerophoria scripta (Diptera: Syrphidae)]. To achieve this objective, we used two sets of 12 species-specific microsatellite markers on a large-scale sampling from all over Europe. Our findings showed a high level of genetic mixing resulting in a lack of genetic differentiation at a continental scale and a great genetic diversity in the two species. All the pairwise FST values between European localities were less 0.05 in the two species. These low values reflect a large-scale genetic mixing probably caused by the existence of frequent migratory movements in the two species. Mantel tests revealed isolation-by-distance pattern on the East-West axis, but not on the North-South axis. This isolation-by-distance pattern confirms the existence of North-South migratory movements in both directions and suggests an important step by step dispersal. Population features shown by this study are common in invasive species and pests, but are not often observed in beneficial species. They reflect great colonization abilities and a high adaptive potential when dealing with a changing environment. Our results highlight the two studied species as particularly interesting beneficial insects for pollination and pest predation in the current context of global change. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Population genetics strategies offer an alternative and powerful approach for obtaining information about long-distance movement, and have been widely used for examining patterns and magnitude of insect dispersal over geographic and temporal scales. Such strategies are based on the principle that genetic divergence between local populations reflects the interplay between genetic drift and gene flow, and thus can function as an indicator of dispersal capacity. Relatively new approaches for inferring population history are widely applicable for documenting introduction routes of invasive or quarantine species. These approaches are based on genetic variability calculated from changes in gene frequency of subpopulations, measured using molecular genetic markers. Inferences from population genetics can supplement and corroborate conventional observational approaches for characterizing insect dispersal and have provided important clues to many questions raised in the field of behavior and ecology of insects. Here, we summarize our work on the boll weevil as a case study to illustrate the kinds of information on dispersal capacity and dispersal patterns that can be obtained from population genetics techniques that would be difficult or impossible to acquire in other ways. Then we provide examples of how the molecular markers and population genetics tools have been applied to answer immediate questions of relevance to eradication program managers. Though the latter are idiosyncratic to this particular pest, they demonstrate the kinds and range of problems that can be addressed in other systems through application of population genetics strategies. © 2012.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about population genetic structure and dispersal capabilities is important for the development of targeted management strategies for agricultural pest species. The apple fruit moth, Argyresthia conjugella (Lepidoptera, Yponomeutidae), is a pre-dispersal seed predator. Larvae feed on rowanberries (Sorbus aucuparia), and when rowanberry seed production is low (i.e., inter-masting), the moth switches from laying eggs in rowanberries to apples (Malus domestica), resulting in devastating losses in apple crops. Using genetic methods, we investigated if this small moth expresses any local genetic structure, or alternatively if gene flow may be high within the Scandinavian Peninsula ({\textasciitilde}850.000 km2, 55o - 69o N). Genetic diversity was found to be high (n = 669, mean He = 0.71). For three out of ten tetranucleotide STRs, we detected heterozygote deficiency caused by null alleles, but tests showed little impact on the overall results. Genetic differentiation between the 28 sampling locations was very low (average FST = 0.016, P {\textless} 0.000). Surprisingly, we found that all individuals could be assigned to one of two non-geographic genetic clusters, and that a third, geographic cluster was found to be associated with 30\% of the sampling locations, with weak but significant signals of isolation-by-distance. Conclusively, our findings suggest wind-aided dispersal and spatial synchrony of both sexes of the apple fruit moth over large areas and across very different climatic zones. We speculate that the species may recently have had two separate genetic origins caused by a genetic bottleneck after inter-masting, followed by rapid dispersal and homogenization of the gene pool across the landscape. We suggest further investigations of spatial genetic similarities and differences of the apple fruit moth at larger geographical scales, through life-stages, across inter-masting, and during attacks by the parasitoid wasp (Microgaster politus).},

However, this pest of tropical origin cannot survive extended periods of freezing temperature but must migrate northward each spring if it is to re-infest cropping areas in temperate regions. The northward limit of the winter-breeding region for North America extends to southern regions of Texas and Florida, but infestations are regularly reported as far north as Québec and Ontario provinces in Canada by the end of summer. Recent genetic analyses have characterized migratory pathways from these winter-breeding regions, but knowledge is lacking on the atmosphere’s role in influencing the timing, distance, and direction of migratory flights. The Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model was used to simulate migratory flight of fall armyworm moths from distinct winter-breeding source areas. Model simulations identified regions of dominant immigration from the Florida and Texas source areas and overlapping immigrant populations in the Alabama–Georgia and Pennsylvania–Mid-Atlantic regions. This simulated migratory pattern corroborates a previous migratory map based on the distribution of fall armyworm haplotype profiles. We found a significant regression between the simulated first week of moth immigration and first week of moth capture (for locations which captured ≥10 moths), which on average indicated that the model simulated first immigration 2 weeks before first captures in pheromone traps. The results contribute to knowledge of fall armyworm population ecology on a continental scale and will aid in the prediction and interpretation of inter-annual variability of insect migration patterns including those in response to climatic change and adoption rates of transgenic cultivars.},

The resulting information was then used to infer migration patterns and population connectivity between breeding grounds in North America and overwintering areas in Mexico and Central America. The microsatellite data revealed genetic structure across the North American continent; populations in the west were found to significantly differ from the east. Minimal genetic structure was observed among western sites. The lack of isolation by distance and low variance in FST values suggests that gene flow could play an ongoing role in limiting genetic differentiation among sites in the western part of the distribution. However, additional information including estimates of effective population size and the proximity of the population to equilibrium is required before the role of gene flow can be assessed fully. Analysis of isotope data showed a negative relationship between latitude and hydrogen isotope ratios in breeding ground individuals. There was a positive relationship between wintering ground latitude and hydrogen isotope ratios for individuals that were genetically western in origin. This is consistent with a leapfrog pattern of migration, in which genetically western birds from the northernmost breeding areas overwinter at the most southerly locations in Central America. Additionally, isotopic ratios of western birds suggest that coastal breeders overwinter in western Mexico, while western birds from further inland and at high elevations overwinter in eastern Mexico. Using information from both genetic an isotopic approaches will probably be useful for identifying patterns of migration and population connectivity between breeding and overwintering areas, both important issues for conservation efforts, and may also contribute to investigation of the evolution of migration.},

We recognize migration as an adaptation to resources that fluctuate spatiotemporally either seasonally or less predictably, and note that it is often preemptive. Migration plays a central role in the spatial dynamics of mobile populations, and is largely distinct in both form and function from the within-population mixing arising from postnatal dispersal and from the interpatch movements characteristic of metapopulations.

	abstract = {Migration by Odonata has been recorded sporadically for several centuries, but only recently have new technologies and a new wave of interest in these ancient insects sparked a concerted effort to understand the extent, behavioral mechanisms, adaptive significance, and ecological consequences of this phenomenon. Here I review our current knowledge of these sometimes spectacular flights, focusing on the few species in North America that are known to migrate more or less annually. One of these, the Common Green Darner, Anax junius, has been shown to traverse hundreds to thousands of kilometers from north to south during fall migration. Pantala flavescens (Wandering Glider) is plausibly inferred to make an overseas flight from India to East Africa with the Northeast Monsoon, although its migrations in North America are less well understood. Large scale movements of these and other species raises questions about population connectivity, ecosystem impacts, the nature and evolution of cues that initiate migration, and effects of climate change on these phenomena. © 2012 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Declines in overwintering colonies of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexxipus) in Mexico raise questions about other life cycle phases, such as spring migration, where monarchs recolonize their breeding range in the United States and Canada with sequential generations. We used data from a long-term citizen science program, "Journey North" (now with 18 yr), to identify possible changes to the recolonization. This program asks people to report the date and location when they see the first adult monarch annually, and this database now contains {\textgreater}11,000 records. We examined sighting dates and migration range size, the latter based on the number of 2-degree latitude - longitude grid squares with monarch sightings, to look for evidence of change in either of these two parameters over the 18 yr. Our analyses used regression models that accounted for increasing volunteer participation over the years. We found monarchs are being sighted later at a rate of 1 d later every 4 yr. This does not appear to be related to later emergence of milkweed, based on examination of milkweed reports. Later sightings could be interpreted as a sign of reductions in monarch abundance (it takes longer to see the first monarch of the year). We also found a potential decline in the geographic range of the initial spring migration wave (a decline of 9\% over 18 yr). However we detected no change in the continental area encompassed at the end of recolonization, indicating monarchs are still successfully filling their traditional breeding range in eastern North America.},

	abstract = {Forensic practitioners, archeologists, and ecologists increasingly use hair isotope profiles and isotope databases and maps to reconstruct the life history of unidentified individuals. Relationships between hair isotope profiles with travel history have been primarily investigated through controlled laboratory experiments. However, those controlled studies do not reflect the complex life history of modern individuals who often travel between multiple locations over different periods. Here, we collect one bundle of hairs from a volunteer whose primary residence is in Ottawa (Canada) but who traveled to multiple destinations over a period of 18 months. Those travels include multi-week trips to distant locations and multi-day trips to more local areas. We use multi-isotope profiles on the individual’s hairs coupled with isotope databases across the world to reconstruct travel history at sub-monthly temporal resolution. We compare the isotopic interpretation of mobility with the recorded travel history. A prominent shift in δ2H values is interpreted as a westward movement toward central Canada, which corresponds to a month-long road-trip to the Prairie. We observed a marked negative excursion in δ13C values along the hairs profile, which was related to a multi-week-long trip to several countries in Europe. Except for an exceptionally variable interval likely driven by health issues, δ15N values show very little fluctuation across the entire profile, indicating consumption of consistent amounts of animal or marine-based protein at different locations. The isotopic shifts in the proximal part of the hair reveal a clearer picture of traveling destinations than the shifts in the distal part, which have larger uncertainty in terms of timing and amplitude. Except for the last couple of months before collection, 87Sr/86Sr ratios show little variation throughout the profile likely due to recent exchange with Ottawa tap water during bathing or showering. The different 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the month preceding collection appear to partially preserve the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of the volunteer’s diet. This study demonstrates the interest of using multi-isotope systems and large isotopic databases to reconstruct individual mobility. This study also underlines the challenges in linking isotope data to mobility, particularly in rapidly growing keratinous tissues.},

Neither food deprivation nor diets of water-stressed maize influenced the proportion of moths flying for long periods. However, a significant increase in the incidence of long flights was recorded in moths from larvae reared at high densities. Significant differences were observed in the weights and sizes of moths from the different larval treatments. Wing-loading was shown to be a function of moth weight, with lighter moths having lower wing-loadings. However, wing-loadings of long-flying moths and those of short-fliers were similar, and it is concluded that the migratory potential of females of S. exempta cannot be predicted from moth weight or morphometric data. A feature of the results was the variable proportion of long-flying moths in the test and control groups, irrespective of larval treatment. Re-examination of the data showed that a high incidence of long flights was evident in the experimental insects at approximately one-generation intervals, and it is suggested that there is a major genetic component in the determination of flight capacity in this species. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Unfortunately, such histories can be misleading.

	abstract = {Background: In the West African Sahel, mosquito reproduction is halted during the 5-7 month-long dry season, due to the absence of surface waters required for larval development. However, recent studies have suggested that both Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles arabiensis repopulate this region via migration from distant locations where larval sites are perennial. Anopheles coluzzii engages in more regional migration, presumably within the Sahel, following shifting resources correlating with the ever-changing patterns of Sahelian rainfall. Understanding mosquito migration is key to controlling malaria - a disease that continues to claim more than 400,000 lives annually, especially those of African children. Using tethered flight data of wild mosquitoes, the distribution of flight parameters were evaluated as indicators of long-range migrants versus appetitive flyers, and the species specific seasonal differences and gonotrophic states compared between two flight activity modalities. Morphometrical differences were evaluated in the wings of mosquitoes exhibiting high flight activity (HFA) vs. low flight activity (LFA). Methods: A novel tethered-flight assay was used to characterize flight in the three primary malaria vectors- An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae s.s. The flights of tethered wild mosquitoes were audio-recorded from 21:00 h to 05:00 h in the following morning and three flight aptitude indices were examined: total flight duration, longest flight bout, and the number of flight bouts during the assay. Results: The distributions of all flight indices were strongly skewed to the right, indicating that the population consisted of a majority of low-flight activity (LFA) mosquitoes and a minority of high-flight activity (HFA) mosquitoes. The median total flight was 586 s and the maximum value was 16,110 s ({\textasciitilde} 4.5 h). In accordance with recent results, flight aptitude peaked in the wet season, and was higher in gravid females than in non-blood-fed females. Flight aptitude was also found to be higher in An. coluzzii compared to An. arabiensis, with intermediate values in An. gambiae s.s., but displaying no statistical difference. Evaluating differences in wing size and shape between LFA individuals and HFA ones, the wing size of HFA An. coluzzii was larger than that of LFAs during the wet season - its length was wider than predicted by allometry alone, indicating a change in wing shape. No statistically significant differences were found in the wing size/shape of An. gambiae s.s. or An. arabiensis. Conclusions: The partial agreement between the tethered flight results and recent results based on aerial sampling of these species suggest a degree of discrimination between appetitive flyers and long-distance migrants although identifying HFAs as long-distance migrants is not recommended without further investigation.},

A key tool in this effort since at least the early 1950s has been the insect flight mill. Nearly 260 studies have been published using flight mills covering 214 species in 61 families and 9 orders.This review explores the methodology and technology of tethered flight in insects using flight mills. The goal is to provide the reader with a historical context of the approach, an understanding of the available tools and technology, background on how best to apply these tools through a comparative lens, and to summarize the wide breadth of factors that have been explored to further our knowledge of insect flight behavior. Overall, it is hoped that the interested reader will understand the limits and benefits of flight mills and will know where to find the resources, and perhaps collaborators, to pursue this line of study.},

However, the trace element abundance and isotopic compositions may be altered by post-eruption environmental processes. Such alterations must be addressed to obtain a meaningful interpretation of hair analysis for biomonitoring. In this study, we used strontium (Sr) isotopic analysis together with sorption kinetics of ionic Sr to quantify the rate and extent of replacement of endogenous Sr in hair by exogenous Sr from ambient water. We found that with only 10 minutes of exposure at room temperature (22°C), more than 30\% of original endogenous Sr in hair was replaced with exogenous Sr from the solution. After 16 days of exposure to the solution, more than 90\% of endogenous Sr was replaced, with a warmer temperature (60°C) accelerating the exchange substantially. We also found that acid leaching of exposed hair did not remove or isolate the exogenous Sr; therefore, neither the original endogenous nor the exogenous 87Sr/86Sr signal could be separated. Nonetheless, these findings illustrated that the quantitative correlation between the fraction of exogenous Sr and the soaking time, if established, could be used to estimate the length of water contact time for hair in forensic studies. Even if such time since initial contact cannot be established, the combination of acid leaching and 87Sr/86Sr analysis of hair samples may still be valuable in provenance studies to identify recent changes in the exogenous Sr pool, including movements or changes in water source.},

	abstract = {Migration has evolved among many animal taxa and migratory species are found across all major lineages. Insects are the most abundant and diverse terrestrial migrants, with trillions of animals migrating annually. Partial migration, where populations consist of resident and migratory individuals, is ubiquitous among many taxa. However, the underlying mechanisms are relatively poorly understood and may be driven by physiological, behavioural or genetic variation within populations. We investigated the differences in migratory tendency between migratory and resident phenotypes of the hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus, using tethered flight mills. Further, to test whether migratory flight behaviour is heritable and to disentangle the effects of environment during development, we compared the flight behaviour of laboratory-reared offspring of migrating, overwintering and summer animals. Offspring of migrants initiated more flights than those of resident individuals. Interestingly, there were no differences among wild-caught phenotypes with regard to number of flights or total flight duration. Low activity in field-collected migrants might be explained by an energy-conserving state that migrants enter into when under laboratory conditions, or a lack of suitable environmental cues for triggering migration. Our results strongly suggest that flight behaviour is heritable and that genetic factors influence migratory tendency in E. balteatus. These findings support the growing evidence that genetic factors play a role in partial migration and warrant careful further investigation.},

Moreover, butterflies flown in the same apparatus under simulated overcast in natural magnetic fields were randomly oriented and did not change direction when magnetic fields were rotated.

This region hosts critical developments in hominin and human evolution, the dispersal of food-producing populations across the continent, and some of the largest known contemporary mammalian migrations on the planet. Strontium isotope analysis of biominerals such as tooth enamel, eggshell, and other tissues in modern animals have been used to reconstruct migration, residential mobility, and provenience. The diverse geologies of Kenya and Tanzania, ranging from the Archaean Basement System rocks of the Tanzania Craton to the recent volcanics of rift valleys, make it a highly promising area for mobility and provenience studies using strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr). Nevertheless, the application of strontium isotope analysis to reconstruct migration and individual mobility has been limited in the region due to the lack of a map predicting biologically available (bioavailable) 87Sr/86Sr. We present bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data from a variety of modern and archaeological materials throughout Kenya and northern Tanzania. We show that 87Sr/86Sr of living organisms in the study area range from as low as 0.70439 for samples collected from Neogene volcanics to 0.72796 for samples collected from Precambrian Basement System rocks. We also present an 87Sr/86Sr map (isoscape) of Kenya and Tanzania developed using a machine-learning framework and a compilation of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr data from Africa. This map provides the first predictions of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr for East Africa, and represents a crucial resource for future work on ancient and modern animal and human mobility.},

In the Andes, obstacles to sample geolocation include overlapping 87Sr/86Sr of distant geographies and a poor understanding of mixed strontium sources in food and drink. Here, water is investigated as a proxy for bioavailable strontium in archeological human skeletal and dental tissues. This study develops a water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape from 262 samples (220 new and 42 published samples), testing the model with published archeological human skeletal 87Sr/86Sr trimmed of probable non-locals. Water 87Sr/86Sr and prediction error between the predicted and measured 87Sr/86Sr for the archeological test set are compared by elevation, underlying geology, and watershed size. Across the Peruvian Andes, water 87Sr/86Sr ranges from 0.7049 to 0.7227 (M = 0.7081, SD = 0.0027). Water 87Sr/86Sr is higher in the highlands, in areas overlying older bedrock, and in larger watersheds, characteristics which are geographically correlated. Spatial outliers identified are from canals, wells, and one stream, suggesting those sources could show non-representative 87Sr/86Sr. The best-fit water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape achieves prediction errors for archeological samples ranging from 0.0017 – 0.0031 (M = 0.0012, n = 493). The water isoscape explains only 7.0\% of the variation in archeological skeletal 87Sr/86Sr (R2 = 0.07), but 90.0\% of archeological skeleton 87Sr/86Sr fall within the site isoscape prediction ± site prediction standard error. Due to lower sampling density and higher geological variability in the highlands, the water 87Sr/86Sr isoscape is more useful for ruling out geographic origins for lowland dwellers than for highlanders. Baseline studies are especially needed in the highlands and poorly sampled regions. Because the results demonstrate that a geostatistical water model is insufficient for fully predicting human 87Sr/86Sr variation, future work will incorporate additional substrates like plants, fauna, soils, and dust, aiming to eventually generate a regression and process-based mixing model for the probabilistic geolocation of Andean samples.},

Soil types were mapped in relation to the texture of the upper horizons and the depth of occurrence of the loamy saprolite. The position of mature individuals of four common species, differing by they rooting depth, was identified and tree leaves were analysed for major nutrients and strontium (Sr) isotopic ratios. On average, the range of leaf isotopic ratio (87Sr/86Sr = 0.714-0.716) was narrow compared to that of bulk soils (87Sr/86Sr = 0.72-0.77). Steep gradients of increasing 87Sr/86Sr in roots with soil depth were found in all investigated profiles, which indicated that the flux of Sr deposited in rain and leached from the litter layer was tightly retained in the upper soil layers. Over the whole of the site, as well as within each soil unit, tree 87Sr/86Sr ratios were very similar whatever the species, and close to litter and near-surface roots 87Sr/86Sr ratios, suggesting no or very little Sr contribution from deep tree roots. Variations of Ca and Sr concentrations in leaves were strongly correlated but not with leaf 87Sr/86Sr ratios. These results support the theory that Sr and Ca uptake and cycling are mostly superficial in tropical rainforests.},

	abstract = {Dispersal is a process of central importance for the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of populations and communities, because of its diverse consequences for gene flow and demography. It is subject to evolutionary change, which begs the question, what is the genetic basis of this potentially complex trait? To address this question, we (i) review the empirical literature on the genetic basis of dispersal, (ii) explore how theoretical investigations of the evolution of dispersal have represented the genetics of dispersal, and (iii) discuss how the genetic basis of dispersal influences theoretical predictions of the evolution of dispersal and potential consequences. Dispersal has a detectable genetic basis in many organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Generally, there is evidence for significant genetic variation for dispersal or dispersal-related phenotypes or evidence for the micro-evolution of dispersal in natural populations. Dispersal is typically the outcome of several interacting traits, and this complexity is reflected in its genetic architecture: while some genes of moderate to large effect can influence certain aspects of dispersal, dispersal traits are typically polygenic. Correlations among dispersal traits as well as between dispersal traits and other traits under selection are common, and the genetic basis of dispersal can be highly environment-dependent. By contrast, models have historically considered a highly simplified genetic architecture of dispersal. It is only recently that models have started to consider multiple loci influencing dispersal, as well as non-additive effects such as dominance and epistasis, showing that the genetic basis of dispersal can influence evolutionary rates and outcomes, especially under non-equilibrium conditions. For example, the number of loci controlling dispersal can influence projected rates of dispersal evolution during range shifts and corresponding demographic impacts. Incorporating more realism in the genetic architecture of dispersal is thus necessary to enable models to move beyond the purely theoretical towards making more useful predictions of evolutionary and ecological dynamics under current and future environmental conditions. To inform these advances, empirical studies need to answer outstanding questions concerning whether specific genes underlie dispersal variation, the genetic architecture of context-dependent dispersal phenotypes and behaviours, and correlations among dispersal and other traits.},

This paper investigates the genetic influence on this variability. The flight capacity was measured in the laboratory by a flight mill and its heritability was estimated for two different strains. The laboratory strain was kept for more than 45 generations and the field strain from Embrach (northern Switzerland) was recently collected in the field. The multiple-trait-restricted-maximum-likelihood method was used for the estimation of genetic variances and covariances. A mixed full-sib/half-sib design was applied for the field strain and a full-sib design for the laboratory strain. The heritability of total distance was 0.57 for the field strain and 0.37 for the laboratory strain (both sexes). In addition, a heritability of 0.38 for total distance was estimated by parent-offspring regression for the laboratory strain. All three values were significantly different from zero (P {\textless} 0.05) and show that there is a significant additive genetic influence on flight capacity. The genetic correlations between total distance and other flight traits (total duration, flight velocity, longest flight) were between 0.84 and 1.00 for both strains and suggest that these traits actually belong to a single one. High genetic correlations were also found between total distance and the morphological traits body weight and wing length for the field strain, whereas a negative correlation was found between total flight distance and body weight for the laboratory strain. This difference between the two strains was interpreted as a possible trade-off between flight capacity and fecundity.},

Pollutants such as pesticides, heavy metals, or airborne fine particulate matter from agricultural and industrial sources are among the factors driving this decline. While these pollutants can have direct detrimental effects, they can also result in negative interactive effects when social insects are simultaneously exposed to multiple stressors. For example, sublethal effects of pollutants can increase the disease susceptibility of social insects, and thereby jeopardize their survival. Here we review how pesticides, heavy metals, or airborne fine particulate matter interact with social insect physiology and especially the insects’ immune system. We then give an overview of the current knowledge of the interactive effects of these pollutants with pathogens or parasites. While the effects of pesticide exposure on social insects and their interactions with pathogens have been relatively well studied, the effects of other pollutants, such as heavy metals in soil or fine particulate matter from combustion, vehicular transport, agriculture, and coal mining are still largely unknown. We therefore provide an overview of urgently needed knowledge in order to mitigate the decline of social insects.},

	abstract = {The degree of heavy metal (Hg, Cr, Cd, and Pb) pollution in honeybees (Apis mellifera) was investigated in several sampling sites around central Italy including both polluted and wildlife areas. The honeybee readily inhabits all environmental compartments, such as soil, vegetation, air, and water, and actively forages the area around the hive. Therefore, if it functions in a polluted environment, plant products used by bees may also be contaminated, and as a result, also a part of these pollutants will accumulate in the organism. The bees, foragers in particular, are good biological indicators that quickly detect the chemical impairment of the environment by the high mortality and the presence of pollutants in their body or in beehive products. The experiment was carried out using 24 colonies of honeybees bred in hives dislocated whether within urban areas or in wide countryside areas. Metals were analyzed on the foragers during all spring and summer seasons, when the bees were active. Results showed no presence of mercury in all samples analyzed, but honeybees accumulated several amounts of lead, chromium, and cadmium. Pb reported a statistically significant difference among the stations located in urban areas and those in the natural reserves, showing the highest values in honeybees collected from hives located in Ciampino area (Rome), next to the airport. The mean value for this sampling station was 0.52 mg kg-1, and July and September were characterized by the highest concentrations of Pb. Cd also showed statistically significant differences among areas, while for Cr no statistically significant differences were found. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Blood metal concentrations have drawbacks as biomarkers stemming from the metals' short biologic half-lives, shipping and storage requirements, and invasive collection procedures. Toenails, which capture a longer exposure period, can be collected non-invasively and stored at room temperature, and can be more feasible and cost-effective for large-scale population studies. Approach: Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) has been used for analysis of toenail metal concentrations, but x-ray fluorescence (XRF) has many advantages in versatility and cost effectiveness over these analyses. This study compared toenail concentrations of manganese (Mn) and lead (Pb) measured with XRF against ICP-MS, in samples collected from 20 adults in Nigeria. To do this we developed a novel calibration method that corrects XRF measurements for toenail weight and thickness to reduce the variability in XRF measurements of toenail clippings. Main results: We found a high correlation (R = 0.91) between toenail manganese metal measurements made with XRF and ICP-MS and a correlation of (R = 0.32) between toenail lead XRF and ICP-MS with over half of the lead results below the detection limit of the instrumentation. Significance: XRF can be used effectively to quantify metals at the part per million level or lower depending on the XRF equipment used in the measurements.},

We compare range and variations in trace element (TE) concentrations and lead (Pb) isotopic compositions of honey, bee tissue, bee pollen, and propolis collected throughout Metro Vancouver (BC, Canada). Honey, bee, and bee pollen results have similar TE and isotopic trends; samples collected in urban and industrialized areas exhibit elevated concentrations of anthropogenically influenced TE (e.g., Pb, Zn, V, and Ti) and a less radiogenic Pb isotopic composition (i.e., lower 206Pb/207Pb and elevated 208Pb/206Pb) relative to their suburban and rural counterparts. For example, 206Pb/207Pb, 208Pb/206Pb in honey range from 1.126, 2.131 and 1.184, 2.063; extremes measured in honey from urban and suburban/rural areas, respectively. Except for propolis, measured and interpolated (kriged) results in all materials reflect the immediate zoning or land use setting near the hive, providing kilometer-scale geospatial resolution, suitable for monitoring urban systems. Statistical analysis reveals that no systematic variations or intra- or inter-annual trends exist in TE concentrations or Pb isotopic compositions, including among sampling and field methods (i.e., old vs. new hive equipment and honey from the brood nest box vs. honey super).

	abstract = {Zinc is a widespread pollutant released from industrial combustion, automobile residue, and mining. Zinc accumulates in soils and mobilises into plant tissue where it may be consumed to potentially toxic levels by leaf feeding insects, including developing pollinators. While zinc tolerance thresholds have been previously assessed in insect pollinators, most observations are limited to model organisms and pest species. We lack understanding of zinc tolerance in insects of conservation concern. We assess dietary zinc tolerance of developing caterpillars from wild populations of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), a species of conservation concern, whose caterpillars are commonly exposed to elevated dietary zinc exposure in milkweed plants along roadsides. We contrast monarch zinc tolerance with that of cabbage white butterfly caterpillars (Pieris rapae), a non-native pest species. Tolerance was assessed by rearing caterpillars on artificial diets containing varying levels of zinc. Zinc reduced monarch survival at levels as low as 344 mg kg−1 but positively impacted cabbage white survival at 227 and 738 mg kg−1. Cabbage whites also displayed prolonged development time, smaller adult body size, and slower growth rate, consistent with the possibility that zinc tolerance had fitness costs. Our results support previous observations that heavy metal tolerance varies between species and highlight the importance of broadening our understanding of tolerance to insect species of conservation concern before drawing general conclusions about insect susceptibility to heavy metal pollution. Nonetheless, our results suggest that zinc pollution alone is unlikely a risk in developing roadside habitat for monarch butterflies.},

Highly significant differences were found with respect to snail abundance and gill parasite abundance. In the three restored sites, significantly more Littoridinops tenuipes were found, and Fundulus heteroclitus had significantly more digenean trematode metacercariae gill infections than at unrestored sites. As habitat quality improves following restoration, the number of suitable digenean trematode parasite hosts multiplies as substrate for benthic invertebrates (first intermediate host) increases and usage by other species, such as Fundulus spp. (second intermediate host), is encouraged, which then attracts more wading birds (definitive host).

Lead pollution in soils can elevate lead in plant tissues, suggesting it could negatively affect neural development of insect herbivores. We used the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae) as a model system to study the effect of lead pollution on insect cognitive processes, which play an important role in how insects locate and handle resources. Cabbage white butterfly larvae were reared on a 4-ppm lead diet, a concentration representative of vegetation in polluted sites; we measured eye size and performance on a foraging assay in adults. Relative to controls, lead-reared butterflies did not differ in time or ability to search for a food reward associated with a less preferred color. Indeed, lead-treated butterflies were more likely to participate in the behavioral assay itself. Lead exposure did not negatively affect survival or body size, and it actually sped up development time. The effects of lead on relative eye size varied with sex: lead tended to reduce eye size in males, but increase eye size in females. These results suggest that low levels of lead pollution may have mixed effects on butterfly vision, but only minimal impacts on performance in foraging tasks, although follow-up work is needed to test whether this result is specific to cabbage whites, which are often associated with disturbed areas.},

The scan employs a specially designed EDXRF spectrometer, which allows a concentration profile of the elements detected in a human nail. In order to carry out this technique, a group of nail fragments taken from different people was analyzed. The elements S, Ca, Cu, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb were detected in most of the samples. A bidimensional (x, y) scan was also performed on a whole removed nail in which the 2D spatial distribution of the detected elements was observed. Significant differences in some of the detected elements were noted. Minimum time of average detection per element was determined, based on the EDXRF spectra of the nail fragment. The time required to obtain an in vivo element profile of a typical nail was thus determined, applying the same geometry and acquisition conditions for all cases. The dose that the person undergoing this type of EDXRF scan analysis would be exposed to was also determined. Exposure time does not exceed 15s, and the calculated administered dose is in the surface nail region of 0.1mGy/s. The results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to carry out an in vivo X-ray fluorescence scan analysis. This information may be used in different fields of medicine, such as nutrition and toxicology, and in other areas that establish a correlation between the concentration of the detected elements and certain diseases. Nail and hair are known to be 'accumulating tissues' unlike bodily fluids. In some aspects, nail analysis can be equal to a blood test.},

	abstract = {Zinc is an essential trace element in humans. Zinc deficiency can result in a range of serious medical conditions which include effects on growth and development, the immune system, the central nervous system, and the gastrointestinal system. Diagnosis of zinc deficiency is often precluded by the lack of a noninvasive and reliable biomarker. Zinc concentration in nail is considered an emerging biomarker of zinc status in humans. Whether zinc in nail accurately reflects zinc status is beyond the scope of the current study, but is an important research question. The development of a portable method to quickly assess zinc concentration from a single nail clipping could be a useful advance. In this study, single toenail clippings from 60 individuals living in Atlantic Canada were measured for zinc using a portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique. These samples were obtained from the Atlantic PATH cohort, part of the largest chronic disease study ever performed in Canada. Each toenail clipping was measured using three 300 s trials with a mono-energetic portable XRF system. Results were then assessed using two different approaches to the XRF analysis: (1) factory-calibrated zinc concentrations were output from each trial, and (2) energy spectra were analyzed for the characteristic X-rays resulting from zinc. Following the measurement of zinc using the non-destructive portable XRF method, the same clippings were measured for zinc concentration using the “gold standard” technique of inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A linear equation of best fit was determined for the relationship between average XRF output zinc concentration and ICP-MS zinc concentration, with a correlation coefficient r = 0.60. Similarly, a linear equation of best fit was found for the relationship between a normalized XRF energy spectrum zinc signal and ICP-MS zinc concentration, with a correlation coefficient r = 0.68. Individual ICP-MS zinc concentrations ranged from 32 μg/g to 140 μg/g, with a population average of 85 μg/g. The results of this study indicate that portable XRF is a sensitive method for the measurement of zinc in a single nail clipping, and provides a reasonable estimation of zinc concentration. Further method development is required before portable XRF be considered a routine alternative to ICP-MS for the assessment of zinc in nail clippings.},

The study was carried out during the spring and summer seasons when the honeybees were active (2019). Fifty-four colonies of honey bees from different apiaries (located in Rudnik, Lazarevac, and Ležimir) were used in this study. Significant differences in element concentrations were found among locations (P {\textless} 0.05). The highest deposition of elements (sodium, calcium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, zinc, arsenic, and cadmium) was found in worker bees. The most commonly detected elements in wax were chromium and lead. Mg had a significant (P {\textless} 0.01) correlation with K, Fe, Cu, and As. This study shows that honey bees (worker bees, drone bees, and bee broods) could be more useful as bioindicators of environmental element deposition (toxic and non-toxic) than multifloral honey. Also, this study shows that Serbian multifloral honey meets safety criteria concerning the concentrations of toxic elements.},

	abstract = {Migratory connectivity describes the degree of linkage between different parts of an animal’s migratory range due to the movement trajectories of individuals. High connectivity occurs when individuals from one particular part of the migratory range move almost exclusively to another localized part of the migratory range with little mixing with individuals from other regions. Conversely, low migratory connectivity describes the situation where individuals spread over a wide area during migration and experience a large degree of mixing with individuals from elsewhere. The migratory connectivity concept is frequently applied to vertebrate migrants (especially birds), and it is highly relevant to conservation and management of populations. However, it is rarely employed in the insect migration literature, largely because much less is known about the migration circuits of most migratory insects than is known about birds. In this review, we discuss the applicability of the migratory connectivity concept to long-range insect migrations. In contrast to birds, insect migration circuits typically comprise multigenerational movements of geographically unstructured (non-discrete) populations between broad latitudinal zones. Also, compared to the faster-flying birds, the lower degree of control over movement directions would also tend to reduce connectivity in many insect migrants. Nonetheless, after taking account of these differences, we argue that the migratory connectivity framework can still be applied to insects, and we go on to consider postulated levels of connectivity in some of the most intensively studied insect migrants. We conclude that a greater understanding of insect migratory connectivity would be of value for conserving threatened species and managing pests.},

The relation between residue concentrations, age (juvenile vs. adult), and sex was investigated. Trace elements were lower than threshold levels of toxicity, except for Pb. Greylag geese sampled could be considered Pb-poisoned. These consequential levels of contamination could be the result of the ingestion of Pb-shot from ammunition used in hunting areas they crossed during migration. Cd accumulation increased with age, whereas Pb levels in feathers were lower in adult birds in connection with moulting. As was influenced by sex.

Trace element concentrations (Ag, As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Zn) were investigated in the liver, kidney, muscle and feathers of 28 dunlins and 15 redshanks accidentally dead during catches by mist net. Analyses of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were carried out in liver, muscle and feathers to determine whether differences in diet explained the variations in elemental levels. These results were compared to previous data obtained on two other shorebird species present on the same sites: the Black-tailed Godwit (Limosa limosa) and the Red Knot (Calidris canutus). This study demonstrated that shorebirds of the Pertuis Charentais were characterized by differential trace element bioaccumulation. Arsenic and Se concentrations in internal tissues were elevated in red knots and dunlins, whereas redshanks displayed higher Cd concentrations. These trace element bioaccumulation discrepancies could mainly come from divergences of trophic habits between shorebirds. Species with the highest trophic position displayed the highest Hg concentrations in the liver, muscle and feathers demonstrating therefore the biomagnification potential of this metal, as opposed to Cd and Pb. The same trend was observed in muscle and feathers for Se and only in feathers for As. These data highlighted the need to study several tissues to obtain a full comprehension of trace element exposure and pathways especially for long-distance migrating species using various habitats and sites. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Nevertheless, secondary contact between sister lineages of local and invasive species provides a natural laboratory to understand the factors that determine introgression and the maintenance or loss of species barriers. Here, we characterize the early evolutionary outcomes following secondary contact between invasive Helicoverpa armigera and native H. zea in Brazil.We carried out whole-genome resequencing of Helicoverpa moths from Brazil in two temporal samples: During the outbreak of H. armigera in 2013 and 2017. There is evidence for a burst of hybridization and widespread introgression from local H. zea into invasive H. armigera coinciding with H. armigera expansion in 2013. However, in H. armigera, the admixture proportion and the length of introgressed blocks were significantly reduced between 2013 and 2017, suggesting selection against admixture. In contrast to the genome-wide pattern, there was striking evidence for adaptive introgression of a single region from the invasive H. armigera into local H. zea, including an insecticide resistance allele that increased in frequency over time. In summary, despite extensive gene flow after secondary contact, the species boundaries are largely maintained except for the single introgressed region containing the insecticide-resistant locus. We document the worst-case scenario for an invasive species, in which there are now two pest species instead of one, and the native species has acquired resistance to pyrethroid insecticides through introgression.},

	abstract = {Climate change is contributing to the widespread redistribution, and increasingly the loss, of species. Geographical range shifts among many species were detected rapidly after predictions of the potential importance of climate change were specified 35 years ago: species are shifting their ranges towards the poles and often to higher elevations in mountainous areas. Early tests of these predictions were largely qualitative, though extraordinarily rapid and broadly based, and statistical tests distinguishing between climate change and other global change drivers provided quantitative evidence that climate change had already begun to cause species' geographical ranges to shift. I review two mechanisms enabling this process, namely development of approaches for accounting for dispersal that contributes to range expansion, and identification of factors that alter persistence and lead to range loss. Dispersal in the context of range expansion depends on an array of processes, like population growth rates in novel environments, rates of individual species movements to new locations, and how quickly areas of climatically tolerable habitat shift. These factors can be tied together in well-understood mathematical frameworks or modelled statistically, leading to better prediction of extinction risk as climate changes. Yet, species' increasing exposures to novel climate conditions can exceed their tolerances and raise the likelihood of local extinction and consequent range losses. Such losses are the consequence of processes acting on individuals, driven by factors, such as the growing frequency and severity of extreme weather, that contribute local extinction risks for populations and species. Many mechanisms can govern how species respond to climate change, and rapid progress in global change research creates many opportunities to inform policy and improve conservation outcomes in the early stages of the sixth mass extinction.},

	abstract = {Study of DNA repeats in model organisms highlights the role of repetitive DNA in many processes that drive genome evolution and phenotypic change. Because repetitive DNA is much more dynamic than single-copy DNA, repetitive sequences can reveal signals of evolutionary history over short time scales that may not be evident in sequences from slower-evolving genomic regions. Many tools for studying repeats are directed toward organisms with existing genomic resources, including genome assemblies and repeat libraries. However, signals in repeat variation may prove especially valuable in disentangling evolutionary histories in diverse non-model groups, for which genomic resources are limited. Here we introduce RepeatProfiler , a tool for generating, visualizing, and comparing repetitive DNA profiles from low-coverage, short-read sequence data. RepeatProfiler automates the generation and visualization of repetitive DNA coverage depth profiles and allows for statistical comparison of profile shape across samples. In addition, RepeatProfiler facilitates comparison of profiles by extracting signal from sequence variants across profiles which can then be analyzed as molecular morphological characters using phylogenetic analysis. We validate RepeatProfiler with data sets from ground beetles ( Bembidion ), flies ( Drosophila ), and tomatoes ( Solanum ). We highlight the potential of repetitive DNA profiles as a high-resolution data source for studies in species delimitation, comparative genomics, and repeat biology.

Although eusocial insects are known to have evolved from solitary ancestors, sociogenomic research among incipiently social taxa has only recently provided empirical evidence supporting theories that modular regulation and deeply conserved genes may play important roles in both the evolutionary emergence and elaboration of insect sociality. There remains, however, a paucity of data to further test the biological reality of these and other evolutionary theories among taxa in the earliest stages of social evolution. Here, we present brain transcriptomic data from the incipiently social small carpenter bee, Ceratina calcarata, which captures patterns of cis-regulation and gene expression associated with female maturation, and underlying two well-defined behavioural states, foraging and guarding, concurrently demonstrated by mothers and daughters during early autumn. We find that an incipiently social nest environment may dramatically affect gene expression. We further reveal foraging and guarding behaviours to be putatively caste-antecedent states in C. calcarata, and offer strong empirical support for the operation of modular regulation, involving deeply conserved and differentially expressed genes in the expression of early social forms.},

Yet, infection-related migration benefits can result from a combination of environmental and/or social conditions, which can be difficult to disentangle. Here, we focus on two infection-related mechanisms that can favour migration: moving to escape versus recover from infection. By directly comparing the evolution of migration in response to each mechanism, we can evaluate the likely importance of changing abiotic conditions (linked to migratory recovery) with changing social conditions (linked to migratory escape) in terms of infection-driven migration. We built a mathematical model and analysed it using numerically simulated adaptive dynamics to determine when migration should evolve for each migratory recovery and social migratory escape. We found that a higher fraction of the population migrated under migratory recovery than under social migratory escape. We also found that two distinct migratory strategies (e.g. some individuals always migrate and others only occasionally migrate) sometimes coexisted within populations with social migratory escape, but never with migratory recovery. Our results suggest that migratory recovery is more likely to promote the evolution of migratory behaviour, rather than escape from infected conspecifics (social migratory escape).},

	abstract = {The generalist cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), can consume host plants in more than 40 families, and often utilizes several tissues of a single plant. It is believed that generalists owe their success to the deployment of various members of multigene families of detoxification and digestive enzymes, a strategy that may also be responsible for rapid evolution of insecticide resistance. However, studies of generalist adaptations have been limited to specific genes or gene families, and an overview of how these adaptations are orchestrated at the transcriptional level is lacking. We used Drosophila melanogaster Meigen gene homology to H. armigera-expressed sequence tags to identify key groups of genes and pathways differentially regulated in the gut of fifth instars after 2days of feeding on a variety of food sources. A series of microarray hybridizations was performed following two alternating loop designs, one comparing the gut gene expression upon feeding on various hosts (cotton, bean, tobacco, and chickpea) and two artificial diets (pinto bean and wheat germ-based), whereas the second design compared the gut expression toward feeding on various plant structures within cotton (leaf, square, and boll). The transcriptional responses toward bean and tobacco feeding treatments were more closely related in comparison with the rest of the diets, whereas the gene expression profiles toward cotton leaf and square-feeding were highly similar. We furthermore found significant changes in several pathways not directly responsible for detoxification mechanisms. Genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism, environmental information processing, and cellular processes were found to be differentially expressed. In addition, regulation of xenobiotic metabolism and the extracellular matrix-receptor pathways appeared differentially regulated across feeding treatments. Three cytochrome P450 genes - CYP6AE17, CYP6B6, and CYP9A17 - grouped as part of a xenobiotic metabolism pathway, were up-regulated in the bean-feeding treatment, and down-regulated in both tobacco and cotton-feeding treatments. CYP4L11, CYP4L5, and CYP4S13 were differentially expressed upon feeding on different cotton plant structures. The present work provides host plant and plant structure-specific transcriptional responses in a lepidopteran herbivore, including pathways and gene candidates for future studies of H. armigera physiology under a more integrative ecologically meaningful framework. © 2012 The Netherlands Entomological Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Although most insect species are specialized on one or few groups of plants, there are phytophagous insects that seem to use virtually any kind of plant as food. Understanding the nature of this ability to feed on a wide repertoire of plants is crucial for the control of pest species and for the elucidation of the macroevolutionary mechanisms of speciation and diversification of insect herbivores. Here we studied Vanessa cardui, the species with the widest diet breadth among butterflies and a potential insect pest, by comparing tissue-specific transcriptomes from caterpillars that were reared on different host plants. We tested whether the similarities of gene-expression response reflect the evolutionary history of adaptation to these plants in the Vanessa and related genera, against the null hypothesis of transcriptional profiles reflecting plant phylogenetic relatedness. Result: Using both unsupervised and supervised methods of data analysis, we found that the tissue-specific patterns of caterpillar gene expression are better explained by the evolutionary history of adaptation of the insects to the plants than by plant phylogeny. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that V. cardui may use two sets of expressed genes to achieve polyphagy, one associated with the ancestral capability to consume Rosids and Asterids, and another allowing the caterpillar to incorporate a wide range of novel host-plants.},

	abstract = {Transcriptome studies of insect herbivory are still rare, yet studies in model systems have uncovered patterns of transcript regulation that appear to provide insights into how insect herbivores attain polyphagy, such as a general increase in expression breadth and regulation of ribosomal, digestion- and detoxification-related genes. We investigated the potential generality of these emerging patterns, in the Swedish comma, Polygonia c-album, which is a polyphagous, widely-distributed butterfly. Urtica dioica and Ribes uva-crispa are hosts of P. c-album, but Ribes represents a recent evolutionary shift onto a very divergent host. Utilizing the assembled transcriptome for read mapping, we assessed gene expression finding that caterpillar life-history (i.e. 2nd vs. 4th-instar regulation) had a limited influence on gene expression plasticity. In contrast, differential expression in response to host-plant identified genes encoding serine-type endopeptidases, membrane-associated proteins and transporters. Differential regulation of genes involved in nucleic acid binding was also observed suggesting that polyphagy involves large scale transcriptional changes. Additionally, transcripts coding for structural constituents of the cuticle were differentially expressed in caterpillars in response to their diet indicating that the insect cuticle may be a target for plant defence. Our results state that emerging patterns of transcript regulation from model species appear relevant in species when placed in an evolutionary context. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Insect migration is globally ubiquitous and can involve continental-scale movements and complex life histories. Apart from select species of migratory moths and butterflies, little is known about the structure of the annual cycle for migratory insects. Using stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of 852 wing samples from eight countries spanning 140 years, combined with 21 years of citizen science data, we determined the full annual cycle of a large migratory dragonfly, the common green darner (Anax junius). We demonstrate that darners undertake complex long-distance annual migrations governed largely by temperature that involve at least three generations. In spring, the first generation makes a long-distance northbound movement (further than 650 km) from southern to northern range limits, lays eggs and dies. A second generation emerges and returns south (further than 680 km), where they lay eggs and die. Finally, a third resident generation emerges, reproducing locally and giving rise to the cohort that migrates north the following spring. Since migration timing and nymph development are highly dependent on temperature, continued climate change could lead to fundamental changes in the biology for this and similar migratory insects.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have found that migratory birds generally have a more diverse array of pathogens such as parasites, as well as higher intensities of infection. However, it is not clear whether this is driven by the metabolic and physiological demands of migration, differential selection on host life-history traits or basic ecological differences between migratory and non-migratory species. Parasitic helminths can cause significant pathology in their hosts, and many are trophically transmitted such that host diet and habitat use play key roles in the acquisition of infections. Given the concurrent changes in avian habitats and migratory behaviour, it is critical to understand the degree to which host ecology influences their parasite communities. We examined nematode parasite diversity in 153 species of Anseriformes (water birds) and Accipitriformes (predatory birds) in relation to their migratory behaviour, diet, habitat use, geographic distribution and life history using previously published data. Overall, migrators, host species with wide geographic distributions and those utilizing multiple aquatic habitats had greater nematode richness (number of species), and birds with large clutches harboured more diverse nematode fauna with respect to number of superfamilies. Separate analyses for each host order found similar results related to distribution, habitat use and migration; however, herbivorous water birds played host to a less diverse nematode community compared to those that consume some animals. Birds using multiple aquatic habitats have a more diverse nematode fauna relative to primarily terrestrial species, likely because there is greater opportunity for contact with parasite infectious stages and/or consumption of infected hosts. As such, omnivorous and carnivorous birds using aquatic habitats may be more affected by environmental changes that alter their diet and range. Even though there were no overall differences in their ecology and life history compared with non-migrators, migratory bird species still harboured a more diverse array of nematodes, suggesting that this behaviour places unique demands on these hosts and warrants further study.},

	abstract = {1. In water-limited environments, the availability of water and nutrients to plants depends on environmental conditions, sizes and shapes of their root systems, and root competition. The goal of this study was to predict root system sizes and shapes for different plant growth forms using data on above-ground plant sizes, climate and soil texture. 2. A new data set of {\textgreater} 1300 records of root system sizes for individual plants was collected from the literature for deserts, scrublands, grasslands and savannas with ≤ 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Maximum rooting depths, maximum lateral root spreads and their ratios were measured. 3. Root system sizes differed among growth forms and increased with above-ground size: annuals {\textless} perennial forbs = grasses {\textless} semi-shrubs {\textless} shrubs {\textless} trees. Stem succulents were as shallowly rooted as annuals but had lateral root spreads similar to shrubs. 4. Absolute rooting depths increased with MAP in all growth forms except shrubs and trees, but were not strongly related to potential evapotranspiration (PET). Except in trees, root systems tended to be shallower and wider in dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates. Shrubs were more shallowly rooted under climates with summer than winter precipitation regimes. 5. Relative to above-ground plant sizes, root system sizes decreased with increasing PET for all growth forms, but decreased with increasing MAP only for herbaceous plants. Thus relative rooting depths tended to increase with aridity, although absolute rooting depths decreased with aridity. 6. Using an independent data set of 20 test locations, rooting depths were predicted from MAP using regression models for three broad growth forms. The models succeeded in explaining 62\% of the observed variance in median rooting depths. 7. Based on the data analysed here, Walter's two-layer model of soil depth partitioning between woody and herbaceous plants appears to be most appropriate in drier regimes ({\textless} 500 mm MAP) and in systems with substantial winter precipitation.},

	abstract = {Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is still sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study and most monitoring methods are labour intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors that can effectively, continuously, and non-invasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the lab. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behaviour, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to the big data outputs to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) Validation of image-based taxonomic identification, 2) generation of sufficient training data, 3) development of public, curated reference databases, and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.Significance statement Insect populations are challenging to study, but computer vision and deep learning provide opportunities for continuous and non-invasive monitoring of biodiversity around the clock and over entire seasons. These tools can also facilitate the processing of samples in a laboratory setting. Automated imaging in particular can provide an effective way of identifying and counting specimens to measure abundance. We present examples of sensors and devices of relevance to entomology and show how deep learning tools can convert the big data streams into ecological information. We discuss the challenges that lie ahead and identify four focal areas to make deep learning and computer vision game changers for entomology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Bin pickingan industrial term for robots that pick up one of many objects randomly placed in a container.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)a deep learning algorithm in the family of neural networks with serval different layers commonly applied for image recognition and classification.

A Reply to Daskalova et al. 2020 EcoEvoRxiv doi:10.32942/osf.io/cg3zs https://ecoevorxiv.org/zyhf7 Summary An accumulating number of studies are reporting severe biomass, abundance and/or species richness declines of insects (Hallmann et al., 2017; Lister \& Garcia, 2018; Seibold et al., 2019; Sánchez-Bayo \& Wyckhuys, 2019). Collectively these studies aim to quantify the net change in invertebrate populations and/or community composition over time and to establish whether such changes can be attributed to anthropogenic drivers (Macgregor, analysed a dataset of arthropod biomass, abundance and species richness from forest and grassland plots in a region of Germany and report significant declines of up to 78\% over the time period of 2008 to 2018 (Seibold et al., 2019). However, their analysis did not account for the confounding effects of temporal pseudoreplication of observations from the same years. We show that simply by including a year random effect in the statistical models and thereby accounting for the common conditions experienced by observations from proximal sites in the same years, four of the five reported declines become non-significant out of six tests overall. To place their estimated effect sizes and those of other recent studies of insect declines in a broader geographic context, we analysed invertebrate biomass, abundance and species richness over time from 640 time series from 1167 sites around the world. We found that the average trend across the terrestrial and freshwater realms was not significantly distinguishable from no net change. Shorter time series that are likely to be most affected by sampling error variance-such as those reported in Seibold et al. 2019-yielded the most extreme estimates of decline or increase. We suggest that the uncritical media uptake of extreme negative trends from short time series may be serving to exaggerate the speed of "insect Armageddon" and could eventually undermine public},

	abstract = {One of the most dramatic examples of biome shifts in the geological record is the rapid replacement of C3 vegetation by C4 grasses in (sub-) tropical regions during the Late Miocene–Pliocene. Climate-driven biome shifts of this magnitude are expected to have a major impact on diversification and ecological speciation, especially in grazing taxa. Mycalesine butterflies are excellent candidates to explore the evolutionary impact of these C3/C4 shifts on insect grazer communities. Mycalesine butterflies feed on grasses as larvae, have radiated spectacularly and occur in almost all extant habitats across the Old World tropics. However, at present, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the larval ecology of these butterflies and this hampers investigations of co-evolutionary patterns among the geographically parallel radiations of mycalesine butterflies and the remarkable evolutionary history of their host plants. By conducting several experiments under defined environmental conditions, we demonstrate that the feeding history of mycalesine larvae on C3 and C4 grasses can be traced by analysing δ13C in the organic material of the adult exoskeleton, while values of δ18O in the adult reflect atmospheric humidity during larval development. To show the power of these isotopic proxies for ecological studies, we analysed the isotopic composition of organic material obtained from adult butterflies sampled in two extensive longitudinal surveys. We observed strong associations among the larval ecology, habitat preferences of the adult butterflies and patterns of seasonality, such that mycalesine species that inhabit open environments are more opportunistic in their host plant choice but utilize C3 grasses more frequently during the dry season. Crucially, the ability to process the less palatable C4 grasses appears to be phylogenetically clustered within mycalesine species, suggesting that novel feeding adaptations may have evolved in response to the ecological dominance of C4 grasses in open savanna habitats.

The use of stable isotope analysis (SIA) in ecological research has dramatically increased in recent years largely because it allows researchers to investigate ecological questions that have been previously difficult to address. 2. Ecological applications of SIA include estimating fundamental niche space and overlap, evaluating trophic or species level interactions, and investigating food web structure. Increasingly, researchers have been incorporating SIA in studies of animal migration, disease transmission, diet composition, nutrient assimilation, and body condition among others. 3. Studies using SIA to evaluate the ecology of terrestrial insects have lagged behind other taxonomic groups. This poor representation of stable isotope studies in publications likely stems from a lack of familiarity of entomologists with this technique. 4. An improved understanding of SIA, as well as the advantages and disadvantages specifically related to insect research, will benefit the field of entomology. In addition, insect-model systems provide unique opportunities for entomologists to incorporate SIA in their research to advance our knowledge of insect biology and the stable isotope ecology of insects. 5. We provide background information on stable isotopes, explain sources of isotopic variation, describe the processes of how isotopes are differentially routed and incorporated into an individual's tissues, explain the principles that influence isotopic fractionation and discrimination, highlight different methods and advancements in SIA, review innovative stable isotope studies, and provide an overview of common mistakes, considerations, and future directions entomologists can explore.},

	abstract = {Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Erebidae) is an international quarantine pest with many hosts, widely distributed in Asia, Europe, and America. L. dispar is distributed mainly in the Eastern Monsoon Region of China. Currently, the most effective means of prevention and control of this pest are timely monitoring and early warning. However, their implementation is usually hampered by the lack of feasible methods and tools for fast tracking and traceability. Stable isotope technology can be used for material traceability, but in China, it is rarely employed for insect traceability. Therefore, using L. dispar as an example, we conducted a case study to explore the feasibility of using hydrogen stable isotopes for pest-source traceability. The grid data of hydrogen stable isotopes of global precipitation were downloaded from the Online Isotopes in Precipitation Calculator (OIPC; Bowen and Revenaugh, 2003, Bowen, 2017), and then, a zoning map of hydrogen stable isotopes of precipitation in mainland China was constructed using ArcGIS 10.4.1 (Esri, Redlands, CA, USA). The wings of 284 L. dispar adults captured in five regions in China were selected as experimental samples. A Finnigan Delta V Advantage Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, U.S.) and a Flash 2000 HT Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, U.S.) were used to measure the hydrogen stable isotope (δ2 H) value of the samples. Then, using the recorded local precipitation hydrogen stable isotope of the sampling site, we performed a data simulation using R software (v.3.2.1; R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria). A linear regression equation was next established: y = 1.186x − 13.247, where x represents the hydrogen stable isotope ratio of precipitation and y denotes the hydrogen stable isotope ratio of L. dispar. The t-test, F-test, and R2 test results confirmed the high significance and matching with the simulation data used in the model. To further verify the accuracy of the model, L. dispar samples from Chengdu in Sichuan Province were collected for model back-testing. The verification results also evidenced that the actual source of the L. dispar sample can be obtained based on the method applied and the model developed in this paper.},

In order for analyses of stable oxygen (δ18O) and hydrogen isotope ratios (δ2H) of fossil chironomid head capsules to be used effectively in paleoecological research, it is necessary to understand the factors controlling their stable oxygen and hydrogen composition. We cultured chironomid larvae in two isotopically distinct waters under controlled, replicated laboratory conditions. Chironomid larvae were fed on identical diets, to examine the degree to which water and diet influence the δ18O and δ2H of these organisms. We used a two-end member mixing model to determine the proportional contributions of oxygen and hydrogen from water to the oxygen and hydrogen of chironomid larvae. Our experiment demonstrated that 69.0 ± 0.4\% of oxygen and 30.8 ± 2.6\% of hydrogen in chironomid larvae are derived from habitat water. Our results show that oxygen isotopes from chironomid remains can better constrain past habitat water isotopic changes compared to hydrogen, due to 69\% of the chironomid oxygen being influenced by habitat water. Our data add to a small but growing suite of comparative data on the sources of oxygen and hydrogen in animal tissues, and provide the first such analyses from aquatic insects. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

In this study the potential of using multi-element stable isotope or trace element analyses to determine the geographical origin of individual specimens has been investigated. RESULTS: The isotope ratios of A. glabripennis individuals for hydrogen varied within and across five locations. Carbon isotope ratios fell within the expected values for C3 plants (trees using the photosynthetic pathway common for moderate climates). Nitrogen isotope ratios indicated separation of UK laboratory from US (New York, Ohio, Massachusetts) beetles, while sulphur isotope ratios distinguished beetles from New York against the other four locations. Three trace elements (TEs) separated UK laboratory-reared beetles from US beetles (Ohio and New York) with ∼ 68\% confidence. CONCLUSIONS: Stable isotope and TE analyses show potential to differentiate between newly arrived A. glabripennis individuals and those from previously undetected in-country populations, which would be of immediate practical benefit in making appropriate strategic decisions on surveillance and eradication. Analyses of additional samples from (i) the same populations, (ii) different locations and (iii) a variety of host trees will enhance the overall picture. © 2016 Crown copyright.

	abstract = {Invasive species alter ecosystems, threaten native and endangered species, and have negative economic impacts. Knowing where invading individuals are from and when they arrive to a new site can guide management. Here, we evaluated how well the stable hydrogen isotope composition (δ2H) records the recent origin and time since arrival of specimens of the invasive Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica Newman) captured near the Portland International Airport (Oregon, U.S.A.). The δ2H of Japanese beetle specimens collected from sites across the contiguous U.S.A. reflected the δ2H of local precipitation, a relationship similar to that documented for other organisms, and one confirming the utility of δ2H as a geographic fingerprint. Within weeks after experimental relocation to a new isotopic environment, the δ2H of beetles changed linearly with time, demonstrating the potential for δ2H to also mark the timing of arrival to a new location. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate the recent geographical origin and timing of arrival of each specimen based on its δ2H value. The geographic resolution was broad, with values consistent with multiple regions of origin in the eastern U.S.A., slightly favoring the southeastern U.S.A. as the more likely source. Beetles trapped from 2007-2010 had arrived 30 or more days prior to trapping, whereas the median time since arrival declined to 3-7 days for beetles trapped from 2012- 2014. This reduction in the time between arrival and trapping at the Portland International Airport supports the efficacy of trapping and spraying to prevent establishment. More generally, our analysis shows how stable isotopes can serve as sentinels of biological invasions, verifying the efficacy of control measures, or, alternatively, indicating when those measures show signs of failure.},

Because insect migrations are common and diverse, studies that examine how migratory insects meet the energetic demands of long-distance movements are badly needed. 2. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate up to 4000 km annually from eastern North America to wintering sites in central Mexico. Autumn generation monarchs undergo physiological and behavioural changes in response to environmental cues to initiate migration. In particular, exposure to cooler temperatures and shorter day lengths in early autumn causes monarchs to enter the hormonally induced state of reproductive diapause. 3. This study examined differences in flight-associated metabolic rate (MR) and flight performance metrics for monarchs experimentally reared under autumn-like conditions (typically experienced before the southward migration) relative to monarchs reared under summer-like conditions. 4. Adult monarchs reared under autumn-like conditions showed lower post-flight MRs, greater flight efficiency, and lower measures of reproductive activity relative to monarchs reared under summer-like conditions. Increases in post-flight metabolism were associated with monarch body weight, age, and flight velocity. 5. These findings suggest that a trans-generational shift in flight energetics is an important component of the monarch's complex migratory syndrome, and that physiological changes that accompany reproductive diapause facilitate energy conservation during flight.},

However, studying migration dynamics in insects is complicated by their small size and short life span which largely prevent the use of conventional techniques based on capture-markrecapture,or remote sensing. Stable isotopes and morphological characters are intrinsic markers that can be used to infer the geographical origin of many organisms including insects. In this study, we first determined whether the hydrogen isotopic ratio and the wing morphometrics are appropriate markers to study the spring migration dynamics of a major aphidophagous hoverfly species ( Episyrphus balteatus). to this end, we assessed themagnitude of variation of these indicators in seven populations along a north-south gradient in Western Europe. Second, we used the two markers in E. balteatus individuals collected in aFrenchagricultural landscape over the course of the spring to assess the proportion of immigrants from southern regions and the period of immigration. Our results revealed uncertainties associated with the use of the hydrogen isotopic ratio and wing morphometrics, but showed that thespring population of E. balteatus in Western France very likelycomprises mainly local individuals, with the probable arrival of some immigrants from nearby regions located further south. The low proportion of immigrants in the spring population has important implications for the biological control provided by E. balteatus in terms of landscape management strategies.

We matched “emerging” (emergence tents) and “colonizing” (pitfall traps) individuals of three carabid species (Trechus quadristriatus, Harpalus rufipes, Pterostichus melanarius) to account for spatial and seasonal variability. There was higher dispersion of δD values among H. rufipes individuals as compared to values of the other two species, which suggests that H. rufipes individuals had the most variable spatial natal origin. The δD values were significantly lower among colonizing compared to emerging individuals in the flight capable and carnivorous species T. quadristriatus. This result suggests long-range migration of T. quadristriatus individuals from remote locations with deuterium depleted (lower δD) meteoric water. Our study provides a first effort towards understanding the δD and δ18O dynamics in epigean carabids in northern European agroecosystems. Additional research on larger (preferably continental) spatial scales and experimental trials that attempt to disentangle major unaccounted sources of variation and decoupling of δD and δ18O among carabids and other invertebrate natural enemies is urgently needed to allow a more frequent use of δD and δ18O dynamics as indicators of long-range dispersal.},

As migratory species and populations vary in the degree to which individuals from distinct breeding locales mix on stop-over sites and wintering grounds, establishing migratory connectivity informs our understanding of population demography and species management. We present a new Bayesian approach for inferring breeding grounds of wintering birds of unknown origins in North America. We incorporate prior information from analysis of genetic markers into geographic origin assignment based upon stable-hydrogen isotope analysis of feathers (δ2Hf), using the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus). Likely geographic origins derived from analyses of DNA microsatellites were used as priors for Bayesian analyses in which birds were assigned to a breeding-ground origin using their δ2Hf values. As with most applications of Bayesian methods, our approach greatly improved the results (i.e. decreased the size of the potential area of origin). Area of origin decreased by 3 to 5-fold on average, but ranged up to a 10-fold improvement. We recommend this approach in future studies of migratory connectivity and suggest that our methodology could be applied more broadly to the study of dispersal, sources of productivity of migratory populations, and a range of evolutionary phenomena. © 2012 Chabot et al.},

	abstract = {Global warming has pronounced impacts on the physiology, development and behavior of multiple organisms and affects the geographical distribution of arthropods. Yet, little is known about how a heightened ambient temperature influences migratory insects that are globally relevant to agriculture. Here, we quantified the extent to which increases in surface temperature, over the span of 3 decades, impact long-distance migration processes of the globally important cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Multi-year monitoring in China indicated how high-altitude migrants of A. ipsilon annually attain two distinct seasonal peaks, i.e., during spring and summer. Stable isotope analyses of field-caught individuals further showed a gradually shifting origin of migrant populations, with ground-level A. ipsilon abundance partially reflecting population levels of high-altitude migrants. Over a 27-year time period, respective population peaks for overwintering and the first-generation A. ipsilon adults were reached 17 and 8 days earlier in the year. Also, the northern border of the A. ipsilon potential overwintering area progressed northward by 58–232 km, and its migration range expanded by 708 km. Our work reveals how a progressively increasing surface temperature affects long-distance migration of a cosmopolitan agricultural pest and alters the population phenology and geographical distribution of A. ipsilon in eastern Asia. Global warming thus influences ecological dynamics in temperate agro-ecosystems and can magnify the economic impacts of long-distance migratory pests.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Seasonal migration and natal dispersal represent the major large-scale movements in the lives of animals. Individuals that are relatively prone to movement and exploration might thus be more likely to disperse and also to migrate farther. Such movement might be either negatively associated with parasitic infection (if infection prevents hosts from successful long-distance migration) or positively associated (e.g. if longer-distance migrants encounter more abundant or more diverse parasites). We examined whether natal dispersal tendency predicts seasonal migration distance in song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) and whether migration distance predicts infection with bloodborne parasites upon arrival at the breeding grounds. Migration distance, inferred from stable hydrogen isotope analysis (δ2H) of winter-grown tissue, was repeatable (repeatability = 0.41) over years. Birds that were more likely to have immigrated from outside the breeding grounds, as inferred from genetic assignment tests, also overwintered farther south, as inferred from stable isotope analysis. The finding that individuals more prone to movement in the context of natal dispersal also tended to travel farther, on average, in the context of seasonal migration suggests consistent individual variation in large-scale movements across these two contexts. Although statistically significant, this effect was modest in scope and subtle relative to sex differences in inferred migration distance. Among after-second-year individuals, but not yearlings, longer-distance migrants were more likely, on average, to be infected with bloodborne parasites. Individual variation in propensity to long-distance movement may interact with age-related variation in exposure or susceptibility to parasites, to shape the role of animal migration in transporting infectious disease. Significance statement: In many animal species, individuals vary consistently in activity and movement over small geographic scales. Large-scale movements such as seasonal migration are of particular interest because they can influence disease risk, but until recently, such movements have been difficult to track. We used stable isotope analysis to estimate overwintering latitude of song sparrows returning to their breeding grounds. Individuals overwintering farther south were also more likely to have immigrated from outside the breeding site, indicating that movement is correlated across the contexts of migration and dispersal. Rates of infection with bloodborne parasites increased with migration distance in older birds, but not in yearlings. Our findings suggest that individual variation in movement may interact with age-related variation in infection risk, to shape the role of animal migration in transporting parasites.},

Investigating dragonfly migration is important for understanding species' life history strategies, migratory connectivity, terrestrial-aquatic linkages, and for successful species conservation. While migration patterns are well-documented for some species (e.g., Anax junius), questions remain about potential migratory behaviour of others. 2. We investigated the potential for migration of Aeshna canadensis (Walker, 1908; Canada darner) using phenological observations in three study ponds in central Minnesota, 2017–2019. We also conducted probabilistic assignment to natal origins by measuring stable hydrogen isotope values of wing tissue (δ2Hw) of dragonflies collected in Minnesota and acquired through Canadian museum collections. 3. This species emerged May–June from study ponds in central Minnesota, with a 10–15 week lag after onset of emergence before mature adults were observed flying and ovipositing in late summer. The probabilistic assignment depictions of emerging tenerals overlapped with the sampling location, confirming accuracy of isotopic assignments of natal origin. 4. Late-flying mature adults collected at our study ponds likely originated from southern Manitoba, suggesting a north–south migration pathway. We found further evidence for migration by analysing δ2Hw of adult dragonflies collected in northern Minnesota and south-central Canada. Their likely origins were farther north in central Canada (Manitoba/Quebec) or the northeastern reaches of this species' range in eastern Canada. 5. We provide the first conclusive evidence of Aeshna migration in North America and demonstrate a robust approach, combining field observations with probabilistic assignment to origin using stable isotope analysis, which can test for migration in other dragonfly populations.},

	abstract = {Tracking devices have become small enough to be widely applied to arthropods to study their movement. However, possible side effects of these devices on arthropod performance and behaviour are rarely considered. We performed a systematic review of 173 papers about research in which tracking devices—radio frequency identification (RFID), harmonic radar and radio telemetry tags—were attached to terrestrial arthropods. The impact of such tags was quantified in only 12\% of the papers, while in 40\% the potential impact was completely disregarded. Often-cited rules of thumb for determining appropriate tag weight had either no empirical basis or were misconstrued. Several properties of a tracking device (e.g. weight, balance, size, drag) can affect different aspects of an arthropod's life history (e.g. energy, movement, foraging, mating). The impact can differ among species and environments. Taken together, these tag effects can influence the reliability of obtained movement data and conclusions drawn from them. We argue that the impact of tracking devices on arthropods should be quantified for each (a) study species, (b) tag type, and (c) environmental context. As an example, we include a low-effort impact study of the effect of an RFID tag on a digger wasp. Technological advancements enable studying the movement of arthropods in unprecedented detail. However, we should adopt a more critical attitude towards the use of tracking devices on terrestrial arthropods. The benefits of tracking devices should be balanced against their potential side effects on arthropods and on the reliability of the resulting data.},

	abstract = {Precipitation stable isotope patterns over continental scales provide a fundamental tool for tracking origins of migratory species. Hydrogen isotopes from rain and environmental waters are assimilated into animal tissues and may thereby reveal the location where tissues were synthesized. Predictive isotopic maps (or isoscapes) of stable hydrogen isotope values in precipitation (δ2Hp) are typically generated by time-averaging observations from a global network of stations that have been sampled irregularly in space and time. We previously demonstrated that restricting the temporal range in δ2Hp isoscapes to biologically relevant time frames did not improve predictions of geographic origin for two migratory species in North America and Europe; rather, it decreased the accuracy of assignment. Here, we examined whether the reduction in assignment accuracy stemmed from a decrease in the number of sampling stations available to support isoscape development for shorter time periods. Multiple regression models were used to predict the hydrogen isotope composition in precipitation using isotopic measurements from each station along with a suite of independent variables. The reduction in the number of stations with δ2Hp measurements used to estimate isoscape model parameters did not alter the accuracy and precision of assignments consistently. We also examined accuracy across a range of reduced station numbers and found that mean accuracy was affected only at very low numbers of stations, indicating that the spatial isotopic patterns in precipitation that are useful for assignment applications can be characterized with data from relatively limited data stations. The number and spatial distribution of stations may have more influence when geostatistical models are used to generate isoscapes, as they incorporate spatial correlation in the dataset. The results can be used to guide future research in understanding how data availability and constraints in creating δ2Hp isoscapes may affect predictions of geographic origins.},

The skill of the interpolation methods was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique; selecting the root-mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE) and the Pearson correlation-coefficient (R) as agreement metrics. To this purpose, data from an irregularly-distributed observational-network comprised by 73 weather-stations were selected for the period 1950-1987. Several spatial fields derived from a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) were tested as covariants. Results from the 10-fold cross-validation test show that CR yielded the best individual performance followed by KED, whereas GAM performed worst. Elevation on the other hand, was the only covariant ultimately incorporated in the interpolation process, since the remaining spatial fields exhibited poor correlation with temperature or resulted in data redundancy. While the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of CR and KED can be said to be comparable, CR is considered the best approach since the method is unaffected by assumptions on data normality and homoscedasticity.},

Our method integrates observed site-referenced biological information on individuals in mixed populations with a particle-tracking model to retrace likely dispersal histories prior to capture (i.e., particle backtracking). To illustrate and test our approach, we focus on western Lake Erie's yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population during 2006-2007, using microsatellite DNA and otolith microchemistry from larvae and juveniles as natural tags. Particle backtracking showed that not all larvae collected near a presumed hatching location may have originated there, owing to passive drift during the larval stage that was influenced by strong river- and wind-driven water circulation. Re-assigning larvae to their most probable hatching site (based on probabilistic dispersal trajectories from the particle backtracking model) improved the use of genetics and otolith microchemistry to discriminate among local breeding subpopulations. This enhancement, in turn, altered (and likely improved) the estimated contributions of each breeding subpopulation to the mixed population of juvenile recruits. Our findings indicate that particle backtracking can complement existing tools used to identify the origin of individuals in mixed populations, especially in flow-dominated systems.},

Recently, the northward extension of B. dorsalis has been reported, and this geographic range increase relates to both climate changes and the rapid development of domestic and international trade and travel. However, it has not been possible to determine the origin of this pest, which is trapped in north China. In this study, traps baited with the sex attractant methyl eugenol were used to collect B. dorsalis in Beijing, China. With these traps B. dorsalis populations were sampled at the same time in 5 different latitudes of China and used to determine the distribution of δ2H stable isotope values. The relationship between rainwater and the B. dorsalis δ2H stable isotope values at these sites was modelled, which then could be used to hypothesize the population origin of B. dorsalis trapped in Beijing, China. The results showed that δ2H stable isotope values for B. dorsalis from Beijing were not consistent with that of the rainwater in Beijing, but rather were consistent with the results obtained from Fuzhou in southeast China. Bactrocera dorsalis trapped in Beijing was not a resident population, and may have come from South China. The fruit and vegetable trade may have vectored the fly northward in China. Our results also showed that δ2H stable isotope technology is a promising strategy for tracing the population origins of invasive fruit flies.},

Here we report our attempt to determine the geographic origin of an auxiliary hoverfly, Episyrphus balteatus, in south-western France. We used quantile regression to calculate the minimum separation distance, based on the International Atomic Energy Agency/World Meteorological Organization (IAEA/WMO) data, at which two insects could be said to originate from different latitudes with a given degree of confidence. We collected larvae in spring 2007 and 2009 to obtain the δD signal of indigenous hoverflies and we trapped adults during one complete year (from Dec. 2006 to Nov. 2007). The smallest separation distance calculated was about 1400 km in western Europe. Our results revealed greater variability in δD of adults in autumn than in spring. From this we infer an autumnal migration. Because of the presence of mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, the δD gradient in precipitation in western Europe is less clear than on the American continent, where it has been used successfully to infer geographical origins of animals under certain conditions. Despite the complications encountered in Europe, the minimum separation distance model proved a useful first step to obtain a first range of possible origins of E. balteatus and the application of the model to other arthropod species in Europe warrants investigation.

Migrating monarchs derived from wide geographic natal origins but lipid δ2H values from migratory cohorts were not related to natal origin. Instead, migrants exploited isotopically similar nectar sources. Distributions of lipid δ2H values in overwintering monarchs were broader and more negative by ∼40‰ suggesting more transport of lipids from higher latitudes or additional nectaring while migrating at higher elevations though northeastern to central Mexico. Our work establishes a new isotopic technique for tracking origins of stored lipids in monarchs and other migratory animals and emphasizes the importance of nectar availability in the southern portion of the range, and especially the nectar corridor through central Mexico.},

In natural populations, however, tissue–environment isotopic relationships are highly variable among animal types and geographic regions. No systematic understanding of the origin(s) of this variability currently exists, clouding the interpretation of isotope data. Here, we present and apply a model, based on fundamental metabolic relationships, to test the sensitivity of consumer tissue H and O isotope ratios, and thus tissue–environment relationships, to basic physiological, behavioral, and environmental parameters. We then simulate patterns in consumer tissue isotopic compositions under several ‘real-world’ scenarios, demonstrating that the new model can reproduce—and potentially explain—previously observed patterns in consumer tissue H isotope ratios, including between-continent differences in feather–precipitation relationships and 2H-enrichment with trophic level across species. The model makes several fundamental predictions about the organic O isotope system, which constitute hypotheses for future testing as new data are obtained. By highlighting potential sources of variability and bias in tissue–environment relationships and establishing a framework within which such effects can be predicted, these results should advance the application of H and O isotopes in ecological, paleoecological, and forensic research.},

	abstract = {Variations in stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios in terrestrial animal tissues are used to reconstruct origin and movement. An underlying assumption of these applications is that tissues grown at the same site share a similar isotopic signal, representative of the location of their origin. However, large variations in tissue isotopic compositions often exist even among conspecific individuals within local populations, which complicates origin and migration inferences. Field-data and correlation analyses have provided hints about the underlying mechanisms of within-site among-individual isotopic variance, but a theory explaining the causes and magnitude of such variance has not been established. Here we develop a mechanistic modeling framework that provides explicit predictions of the magnitude, patterns, and drivers of isotopic variation among individuals living in a common but environmentally heterogeneous habitat. The model toolbox includes isoscape models of environmental isotopic variability, an agent-based model of behavior and movement, and a physiology-biochemistry model of isotopic incorporation into tissues. We compare model predictions against observed variation in hatch-year individuals of the songbird Spotted Towhee (Pipilo maculatus) in Red Butte Canyon, Utah, and evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce this variation under different sets of assumptions. Only models that account for environmental isotopic variability predict a similar magnitude of isotopic variation as observed. Within the modeling framework, behavioral rules and properties govern how animals nesting in different locations acquire resources from different habitats, and birds nesting in or near riparian habitat preferentially access isotopically lighter resources than those associated with the meadow and slope habitats, which results in more negative body water and tissue isotope values. Riparian nesters also have faster body water turnover and acquire more water from drinking (vs. from food), which exerts a secondary influence on their isotope ratios. Thus, the model predicts that local among-individual isotopic variance is linked first to isotopic heterogeneity in the local habitat, and second to how animals sample this habitat during foraging. Model predictions provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of small-scale isotopic variance and can be used to predict the utility of isotope-based methods for specific groups or environments in ecological and forensic research.},

	abstract = {Organisms assess biotic and abiotic cues at multiple sites when deciding where to settle. However, due to temporal constraints on this prospecting, the suitability of available habitat may be difficult for an individual to assess when cues are most reliable, or at the time they are making settlement decisions. For migratory birds, the postbreeding season may be the optimal time to prospect and inform settlement decisions for future breeding seasons. We investigated the fall movements of flammulated owls (Psiloscops flammeolus) within breeding habitat after fledglings had gained independence and before adults left for migration. From 2013 to 2016, we trapped owls within a breeding population wherein all nesting owls and their young have been banded since 1981. We used stable isotopes in combination with mark–recapture data to identify local individuals and differentiate potential prospecting behavior from other seasonal movements such as migration or staging. We commonly captured owls in the fall—predominantly hatch-year owls—that were not known residents of the study area. Several of these nonresident owls were later found breeding within the study area. Stable isotope data suggested a local origin for virtually all owls captured during the fall. Our results suggest that hatch-year flammulated owls, but also some after-hatch-year owls, use the period between the breeding season and fall migration to prospect for future breeding sites. The timing of this behavior is likely driven by seasonally variable costs associated with prospecting. Determining the timing of prospecting and the specific cues that are being assessed will be important in helping predict the extent to which climate change and/or altered disturbance regimes will modify the ecology, behavior, and demographics associated with prospecting.},

	doi = {10.1111/joa.12362},
	abstract = {Dragonflies count among the most skilful of the flying insects. Their exceptional aerodynamic performance has been the subject of various studies. Morphological and kinematic investigations have showed that dragonfly wings, though being rather stiff, are able to undergo passive deformation during flight, thereby improving the aerodynamic performance. Resilin, a rubber-like protein, has been suggested to be a key component in insect wing flexibility and deformation in response to aerodynamic loads, and has been reported in various arthropod locomotor systems. It has already been found in wing vein joints, connecting longitudinal veins to cross veins, and was shown to endow the dragonfly wing with chordwise flexibility, thereby most likely influencing the dragonfly's flight performance. The present study revealed that resilin is not only present in wing vein joints, but also in the internal cuticle layers of veins in wings of Sympetrum vulgatum (SV) and Matrona basilaris basilaris (MBB). Combined with other structural features of wing veins, such as number and thickness of cuticle layers, material composition, and cross-sectional shape, resilin most probably has an effect on the vein′s material properties and the degree of elastic deformations. In order to elucidate the wing vein ultrastructure and the exact localisation of resilin in the internal layers of the vein cuticle, the approaches of bright-field light microscopy, wide-field fluorescence microscopy, confocal laser-scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were combined. Wing veins were shown to consist of up to six different cuticle layers and a single row of underlying epidermal cells. In wing veins of MBB, the latter are densely packed with light-scattering spheres, previously shown to produce structural colours in the form of quasiordered arrays. Longitudinal and cross veins differ significantly in relative thickness of exo- and endocuticle, with cross veins showing a much thicker exocuticle. The presence of resilin in the unsclerotised endocuticle suggests its contribution to an increased energy storage and material flexibility, thus to the prevention of vein damage. This is especially important in the highly stressed longitudinal veins, which have much lower possibility to yield to applied loads with the aid of vein joints, as the cross veins do. These results may be relevant not only for biologists, but may also contribute to optimise the design of micro-air vehicles.},

The degradation rate was much faster than that of the ultrasonic degradation, and it was comparable to that of the enzymatic hydrolysis of chitosan. Chain-end scissions occurred after chitosan was degraded severely and produced significant amounts of oligosaccharides at temperatures ≥80 °C. Universal calibration moderated the change in molecular weight more closely than that calculated by the usual calibration using pullulan standards. Trace amounts of transition metal ions and the amino groups in chitosan were critical to the breakdown of the β-1,4 glycosidic linkages. HPLC results of glucosamine and chito-oligosaccharides could be characterized by correlating the logarithmic values of retention time with the degrees of polymerization.

	abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of the common structural biopolymer chitin are a potential recorder of ecological and environmental information, but our understanding of the mechanisms of incorporation of H and O from environmental substrates into chitin is limited. We report the results of a set of experiments in which the isotopic compositions of environmental water and diet were varied independently in order to assess the contribution of these variables to the H and O isotopic composition of Artemia franciscana chitin. Hydrogen isotope ratios of chitin were strongly linearly correlated with both food and water, with approximately 26\% of the hydrogen signal reflecting food and approximately 38\% reflecting water. Oxygen isotopes were also strongly correlated with the isotopic composition of water and food, but whereas 69\% of oxygen in chitin exchanged with environmental water, only 10\% was derived from food. We propose that these observations reflect the position-specific, partial exchange of H and O atoms with brine shrimp body water during the processes of digestion and chitin biosynthesis. Comparison of culture experiments with a set of natural samples collected from the Great Salt Lake, UT in 2006 shows that, with some exceptions, oxygen isotope compositions of chitin track those of water, whereas hydrogen isotopes vary inversely with those of lake water. The different behavior of the two isotopic systems can be explained in terms of a dietary shift from allochthonous particulate matter with relatively higher δ2H values in the early spring to autochthonous particulate matter with significantly lower δ2H values in the late summer to autumn. These results suggest oxygen in chitin may be a valuable proxy for the oxygen isotopic composition of environmental water, whereas hydrogen isotope values from the same molecule may reveal ecological and biogeochemical changes within lakes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {We describe a conceptual framework integrating animal personalities, movement ecology, social networks and parasite transmission. For directly transmitted parasites, parasite transmission depends on social interaction patterns that can be quantified using social network metrics. For indirectly transmitted parasites, the key can be transmission networks that quantify time-lagged contacts (e.g. where potential hosts visit locations used earlier by infected hosts). Social network connections (time-lagged or not) often result from shared space use determined by individual movements in response to key environmental factors. Movement ecology provides a framework for understanding these responses. Finally, individuals with different personalities likely respond differently to environmental factors in ways that influence the movements and space use that underlie network connectivity, which, in turn, affects parasite loads and transmission. We illustrate these key points with recent work on sleepy lizards, Tiliqua rugosa, and their ticks. By GPS tracking of nearly all adult lizards at our site, we found that lizards that more frequently shared the same refuges (where ticks detach and reattach to a new host) used earlier by other lizards tended to indeed have higher tick loads. Higher shared refuge use was associated with greater shared space use, in general. Shared space use with conspecifics was reduced by the lizards' general propensity (quantified by analyses of 279 985 GPS locations for 72 lizards) to avoid conspecifics, but enhanced by their general tendency to prefer areas with more resources and better refuge (in particular, late in the season when food was scarce and conditions were hotter and drier). Both of these tendencies were personality dependent. Less aggressive lizards exhibited both a stronger attraction to areas with more food and better refuge, and a stronger tendency to avoid other lizards. We conclude by discussing implications of our results for the general conceptual framework and suggest future directions.},

Results have shown that the effect of parasitic links on community structure depends on both the level of parasite richness and network architecture. Particularly for architecture network generated by inverse niche model, the standard deviation of vulnerability with low connectance of parasitic links amazingly reaches a hollow at moderate parasite richness, but high for the extreme richness (weak or strong). Although network architecture can strongly affect topological properties of multihost community, it can only weakly influence the ability of species to coexist. The results emphasize that addition of parasites in the ecosystem could be an important process for species diversity and topological structure of ecological network.},

Flexibility of the photoperiodic response is critical for rapid shifts to new hosts, survival in the face of global climate change and to reproductive isolation. At the same time, the daily circadian clock is also essential for development, diapause and multiple behaviours, including correct flight orientation during longdistance migration. Although studied for decades, how these two critical biological timing mechanisms are integrated is poorly understood, in part because the core circadian clock genes are all transcription factors or regulators that are able to exert multiple effects throughout the genome. In this chapter, we discuss clocks in the wild from the perspective of diverse insect groups across eco-geographic contexts from the Antarctic to the tropical regions of Earth. Application of the expanding tool box of molecular techniques will lead us to distinguish universal from unique mechanisms underlying the evolution of circadian and photoperiodic timing, and their interaction across taxonomic and ecological contexts represented by insects.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Differences in stable isotope composition between an animal and its diet are quantified by experimentally derived diet-tissue discrimination factors. Appropriate discrimination factors between consumers and prey are essential for interpreting stable isotope patterns in ecological studies. While available for many taxa, these values are rarely estimated for organisms within the carrion food web. Methods: We used a controlled-diet stable isotope feeding trial to quantify isotopic diet-tissue discrimination factors of carbon (δ13C values) and nitrogen (δ15N values) from laboratory-reared Nicrophorus americanus raised on carrion. We used exoskeleton samples of beetle elytra (wing covers) to determine diet-tissue discrimination factors using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer equipped with an elemental analyzer. We also measured the isotopic compositions of five species of co-occurring, wild-caught burying beetles and evaluated feeding relationships. Results: We found differences in stable carbon discrimination between carrion sources (mammalian and avian) and lab-reared beetles, but no difference in stable nitrogen discrimination. Values for δ13C did not differ among wild-caught burying beetle species, but values for δ15N were significantly different for the three species with overlapping breeding seasons. Furthermore, wild-caught burying beetles within our study area do not appear to use avian carrion resources to rear their young. Conclusions: This study informs future interpretation of stable isotope data for insects within the carrion food web. In addition, these results provide insight into carrion resources used by co-occurring burying beetle species in situ. We also demonstrated that independent of adult food type, the larval food source has a significant impact on the isotopic signatures of adult beetles, which can be estimated using a minimally invasive elytra clipping.},

Limited recombination in these haplotype blocks keeps adaptive alleles together, and these regions differentiate sunflower ecotypes. For example, haplotype blocks control a 77-day difference in flowering between ecotypes of the silverleaf sunflower H. argophyllus (probably through deletion of a homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)), and are associated with seed size, flowering time and soil fertility in dune-adapted sunflowers. These haplotypes are highly divergent, frequently associated with structural variants and often appear to represent introgressions from other—possibly now-extinct—congeners.

	abstract = {Whether adaptation is limited by the beneficial mutation supply is a long-standing question of evolutionary genetics, which is more generally related to the determination of the adaptive substitution rate and its relationship with the effective population size Ne. Empirical evidence reported so far is equivocal, with some but not all studies supporting a higher adaptive substitution rate in large-Ne than in small-Ne species.We gathered coding sequence polymorphism data and estimated the adaptive amino-acid substitution rate ωa, in 50 species from ten distant groups of animals with markedly different population mutation rate θ. We reveal the existence of a complex, timescale dependent relationship between species adaptive substitution rate and genetic diversity. We find a positive relationship between ωa and θ among closely related species, indicating that adaptation is indeed limited by the mutation supply, but this was only true in relatively low-θ taxa. In contrast, we uncover a weak negative correlation between ωa and θ at a larger taxonomic scale. This result is consistent with Fisher’s geometrical model predictions and suggests that the proportion of beneficial mutations scales negatively with species’ long-term Ne.},

	abstract = {Each fall, eastern North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) migrate from their northern range to their overwintering grounds in central Mexico [1-3]. Fall migrants are in reproductive diapause, and they use a time-compensated sun compass to navigate during the long journey south [4-6]. Eye-sensed directional cues from the daylight sky (e.g., the horizontal or azimuthal position of the sun) are integrated in the sun compass in the midbrain central complex region [7, 8]. Sun compass output is time compensated by circadian clocks in the antennae so that fall migrants can maintain a fixed flight direction south [9, 10]. In the spring, the same migrants remigrate northward to the southern United States to initiate the northern leg of the migration cycle. Here we show that spring remigrants also use an antenna-dependent time-compensated sun compass to direct their northward flight. Remarkably, fall migrants prematurely exposed to overwintering-like coldness reverse their flight orientation to the north. The temperature microenvironment at the overwintering site is essential for successful completion of the migration cycle, because without cold exposure, aged migrants continue to orient south. Our discovery that coldness triggers the northward flight direction in spring remigrants solves one of the long-standing mysteries of the monarch migration. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) are one of the major superradiations of insects, comprising nearly 160,000 described extant species. As herbivores, pollinators, and prey, Lepidoptera play a fundamental role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem. Lepidoptera are also indicators of environmental change and serve as models for research on mimicry and genetics. They have been central to the development of coevolutionary hypotheses, such as butterflies with flowering plants and moths’ evolutionary arms race with echolocating bats. However, these hypotheses have not been rigorously tested, because a robust lepidopteran phylogeny and timing of evolutionary novelties are lacking. To address these issues, we inferred a comprehensive phylogeny of Lepidoptera, using the largest dataset assembled for the order (2,098 orthologous protein-coding genes from transcriptomes of 186 species, representing nearly all superfamilies), and dated it with carefully evaluated synapomorphybased fossils. The oldest members of the Lepidoptera crown group appeared in the Late Carboniferous (∼300 Ma) and fed on nonvascular land plants. Lepidoptera evolved the tube-like proboscis in the Middle Triassic (∼241 Ma), which allowed them to acquire nectar from flowering plants. This morphological innovation, along with other traits, likely promoted the extraordinary diversification of superfamily-level lepidopteran crown groups. The ancestor of butterflies was likely nocturnal, and our results indicate that butterflies became day-flying in the Late Cretaceous (∼98 Ma). Moth hearing organs arose multiple times before the evolutionary arms race between moths and bats, perhaps initially detecting a wide range of sound frequencies before being co-opted to specifically detect bat sonar. Our study provides an essential framework for future comparative studies on butterfly and moth evolution.},

However, the potential of 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel to track high-frequency movements has not yet been established, in part due to the lack of data on modern animals of known movement and predictive model of isotope variation across the landscape. To tackle this issue, we measured the 87Sr/86Sr in plant samples taken from a 2000 km2 area in the Altai Mountains (Mongolia), and the 87Sr/86Sr in tooth enamel of domestic caprines whose mobility was monitored using GPS tracking. We show that high-resolution, sequential profiles of strontium isotope composition of tooth enamel reliably reflect the high-frequency mobility of domestic livestock and that short-term residency of about 45 days can be resolved. This offers new perspectives in various disciplines, including forensics, ecology, palaeoanthropology, and bioarchaeology.},

	doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.13434},
	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

We gathered an extensive occurrence dataset for butterflies of the study area (27,123 records, 269 species, in cells of 0.5x0.5 degrees of latitude‐longitude). We applied molecular‐based delimitation methods (GMYC model) to 26,557 COI sequences of Western Palearctic butterflies. We identified entities based on molecular delimitations and/or the checklist of European butterflies and objectively attributed occurrences to their most probable entity. We obtained a zoogeographic regionalisation based on the 69 endemics of the area. Using phylogenetic ANOVA we tested if endemics from different centres differ from each other and from non‐endemics for key ecological traits and divergence time. Endemicity showed high incidence in the Alps and Southern Italy. The regionalisation separated the Alps from the Italian Peninsula and Sicily. The endemics of different centres showed a high turnover and differed in phylogenetic distances, phenology and distribution traits. Endemics are on average younger than non‐endemics and the Peninsula‐Sicily endemics also have lower variance in divergence than those from the Alps. The observed variation identifies Alpine endemics as paleoendemics, now occupying an ecological centre, and the Peninsula‐Sicily ones as neoendemics, that diverged in the region since the Pleistocene. The results challenge the common view of the Alpine‐Apennine area as a single "Italian refugium".{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We present a general framework for modelling subsistence and health of the rural poor by coupling simple dynamic models of population ecology with those for economic growth. The models show that feedbacks between the biological and economic systems can lead to a state of persistent poverty. Analyses of a wide range of specific systems under alternative assumptions show the existence of three possible regimes corresponding to a globally stable development equilibrium, a globally stable poverty equilibrium and bistability. Bistability consistently emerges as a property of generalized disease-economic systems for about a fifth of the feasible parameter space. The overall proportion of parameters leading to poverty is larger than that resulting in healthy/wealthy development. All the systems are found to be most sensitive to human disease parameters. The framework highlights feedbacks, processes and parameters that are important to measure in studies of rural poverty to identify effective pathways towards sustainable development.},

The results of these analyses can be difficult to interpret accurately, because doing so requires some understanding of their theoretical basis and of their sensitivity to confounding factors. In this practical review, we explain some of the key concepts underpinning the pairwise and multiple sequentially Markovian coalescent methods (PSMC and MSMC, respectively). We relate these concepts to the use and interpretation of these methods, and we explain how the choice of different parameter values by the user can affect the accuracy and precision of the inferences. Based on our survey of 100 PSMC studies and 30 MSMC studies, we describe how the two methods are used in practice.

	abstract = {The measurement of stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes in tissues of organisms has formed the foundation of isotopic food web reconstructions, as these values directly reflect assimilated diet. In contrast, stable hydrogen (δ 2 H) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotope measurements have typically been reserved for studies of migratory origin and paleoclimate reconstruction based on systematic relationships between organismal tissue and local environmental water. Recently, innovative applications using δ 2 H and, to a lesser extent, δ 18 O values have demonstrated potential for these elements to provide novel insights in modern food web studies. We explore the advantages and challenges associated with three applications of δ 2 H and δ 18 O values in food web studies. First, large δ 2 H differences between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystem end members can permit the quantification of energy inputs and nutrient fluxes between these two sources, with potential applications for determining allochthonous vs. autochthonous nutrient sources in freshwater systems and relative aquatic habitat utilization by terrestrial organisms. Next, some studies have identified a relationship between δ 2 H values and trophic position, which suggests that this marker may serve as a trophic indicator, in addition to the more commonly used δ 15 N values. Finally, coupled measurements of δ 2 H and δ 18 O values are increasing as a result of reduced analytical challenges to measure both simultaneously and may provide additional ecological information over single element measurements. In some organisms, the isotopic ratios of these two elements are tightly coupled, whereas the isotopic disequilibrium in other organisms may offer insight into the diet and physiology of individuals. Although a coherent framework for interpreting δ 2 H and δ 18 O data in the context of food web studies is emerging, many fundamental uncertainties remain. We highlight directions for targeted research that will increase our understanding of how these markers move through food webs and reflect ecological processes.},

Furthermore, the vast majority of the literature assessing sex differences in cognition is based on studies of humans and a few other mammals. In order to elucidate the underpinnings of cognitive variation and the potential for fitness consequences, we must investigate sex differences in cognition in non-mammalian systems as well. Here, we assess the performance of male and female food-caching birds on a spatial learning and memory task and a reversal spatial task to address whether there are sex differences in mean cognitive performance or in the range of variation in performance. For both tasks, male and female mean performance was similar across four years of testing; however, males did exhibit a wider range of variation in performance on the reversal spatial task compared with females. The implications for mate choice and sexual selection of cognitive abilities are discussed and future directions are suggested to aid in the understanding of sex-related cognitive variation.},

To date, there has been little agreement in the way laboratories prepare, measure, and correct for uncontrolled hydrogen isotopic exchange in complex organic samples, resulting in incomparable δD results. Previously, nitration and preparative equilibration procedures aimed at controlling exchangeable hydrogen were designed for specific sample types (e.g. cellulose, chitin) but required extensive processing of individual samples. Here we describe a static, high-temperature preparative equilibration technique that provides increased sample throughput and δD measurements that are not compromised by uncontrolled isotopic exchange. By adopting this approach, it will be possible to compare complex organic δD measurements among laboratories. The current inconsistency in organic δD measurements among laboratories seriously hampers comparison of results among studies. As pyroiltic continuous-flow δD analyses become available, the preparative equilibration method described can be adapted to suit the smaller size requirements.},

	doi = {10.1525/auk.2009.08009},
	abstract = {Despite the widespread use of stable isotopes in studies of avian movement, key assumptions on which the methodology is based remain unsubstantiated, including the assumption that measurements of stable hydrogen isotopes in feathers (δDf) are consistent across time within the same laboratory or among laboratories using the same analytical protocols and keratin standards. We tested this assumption by remeasuring δDf from 211 raptor feathers within and between laboratories. Initial and repeat samples were prepared and analyzed using identical protocols but analyzed in distinct automated runs with laboratory staff blind to sample identity. Reproducibility of δDf measurements varied significantly and substantially among nine independent sample groups. Feather δD measurements among sample groups exhibited average isotopic shifts from -15.6‰ to +27.5‰ (an absolute difference of 43.1‰), with standard deviations from 6.0‰ to 12.4‰. Therefore, despite existing analytical protocols to address issues of reproducibility, empirical data suggest that comparing δDf measurements among studies or labs and pooling samples analyzed during different automated runs within a laboratory remain problematic. More importantly, poor reproducibility compromises the geographic assignment of origins based on δDf, because the substantial differences in δDf measurements between automated runs can result in spurious inferences regarding the origins of migratory birds. We caution against the continued use of δDf for predicting geographic origin, and for addressing important conservation questions, until the factors affecting poor reproducibility are identified and improved reproducibility is demonstrated within and among laboratories across time and taxa. © 2009 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

This chapter intends to answer this question in a positive sense and helps to analyze forms and contents of such political dimension in Western countries. The main thesis is that an “implicit smart politics” exists. This type of politics is often not identifiable as such, not subjected to a real process of political institutionalization, and strongly diffused among the various social actors. Moreover, we affirm that the ‘implicit’ character of the smart politics is intertwined with the great changes of modern politics caused by the processes of globalization and by the transformations of the role and meaning of the modern state. Thereafter, this chapter discusses the central risks of the implicit smart politics, whose lack of institutionalization in genuinely democratic political forums may favor the excessive power of economic-financial and technological actors. In the final analysis, we argue for an overall political vision and a long-term political project, which guarantees the recognition and limitability of power and defines the forms of political and democratic participation.},

	doi = {10.1101/207662},
	abstract = {Abstract Isoscapes are maps depicting the continuous spatial (and sometimes temporal) variation in isotope composition. They have various applications ranging from the study of isotope circulation in the main earth systems to the determination of the provenance of migratory animals. Isoscapes can be produced from the fit of statistical models to observations originating from a set of discrete locations. Mixed models are powerful tools for drawing inferences from correlated data. While they are widely used to study non-spatial variation, they are often overlooked in spatial analyses. In particular, they have not been used to study the spatial variation of isotope composition. Here, we introduce this statistical framework and illustrate the methodology by building isoscapes of the isotope composition of hydrogen (measured in δ2H) for precipitation water in Europe. For this example, the approach based on mixed models presents a higher predictive power than a widespread alternative approach. We discuss other advantages offered by mixed models including: the ability to model the residual variance in isotope composition, the quantification of prediction uncertainty, and the simplicity of model comparison and selection using an adequate information criterion: the conditional AIC (cAIC). We provide all source code required for the replication of the results of this paper as a small R package to foster a transparent comparison between alternative frameworks used to model isoscapes.

Miniaturization of a thermolysis reactor using commercially available components is presented that results in improvement in the limit of measurement for both hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios. 2H was determined on 0.4 μg of H and 18O determined on 5 μg of O with precisions of 3 mUr and 0.7 mUr, respectively.

It has become commonplace to extract predictions of individual random effects from such models for use in subsequent analyses (for example, between a personality trait and other individual traits such as cognition, physiology, or fitness-related measures). However, these predictions are made with large amounts of error that is not carried forward, rendering further tests susceptible to spurious P values from these individual-level point estimates.

Philosophers of mind have recently discussed in detail the difference between thinking of human behaviour as action and thinking of it as movement, and I argue that this distinction is in some ways analogous to the distinction between behaviour categorized by function and by form. Wherever more than one conceptual scheme is employed in a science there is a pressure to run together concepts taken from the different schemes, and I show that such conceptual confusion in ethology can lead to obscurity, misrepresentation of experimental results, and the construction of unfruitful theories. © 1978.},

	abstract = {Permafrost in the Arctic is decreasing in extent and the depth of the seasonally thawed layer, the active layer, is increasing. Increased exposure to water is increasing fluxes of organic and inorganic solutes with potential impacts for the global carbon cycle and downstream ecosystems. Understanding the relationship between solute release and active layer depth will be critical for modeling environmental impact, especially in inaccessible regions where there is a lack of data. In this study, we focus on the potential for the isotopes of lithium (Li) and uranium (U) to track active layer extent in two permafrost-dominated catchments in Svalbard: one glaciated and one unglaciated. These isotope systems can be measured to a much higher precision than concentration measurements and act as sensitive tracers of environmental change. The extent of Li isotope fractionation provides information on the balance between dissolution of primary phases and formation of secondary phases, such as clay minerals and oxides. The U activity ratio provides information on water-rock interaction times and physical properties. We observe contrasting behavior between the two catchments. The highest U activity ratios and Li isotope values (those most distinct from bedrock) are observed in summer in the unglaciated catchment, when the active layer depth is expected to be at its maximum extent, whereas negligible seasonal variation and the lowest values are observed in the glaciated catchment. We therefore propose that the extent of solute acquisition is directly linked to the active layer depth, which is restricted in the glaciated catchment due to a layer of “dead ice” underneath the glacial outwash plain, and could therefore provide a valuable tool to assess changes in active layer depth at catchment scales.},

	abstract = {Many animal personality traits have implicit movement-based definitions and can directly or indirectly influence ecological and evolutionary processes. It has therefore been proposed that animal movement studies could benefit from acknowledging and studying consistent interindividual differences (personality), and, conversely, animal personality studies could adopt a more quantitative representation of movement patterns. Using high-resolution tracking data of three-spined stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), we examined the repeatability of four movement parameters commonly used in the analysis of discrete time series movement data (time stationary, step length, turning angle, burst frequency) and four behavioral parameters commonly used in animal personality studies (distance travelled, space use, time in free water, and time near objects). Fish showed repeatable interindividual differences in both movement and behavioral parameters when observed in a simple environment with two, three, or five shelters present. Moreover, individuals that spent less time stationary, took more direct paths, and less commonly burst travelled (movement parameters), were found to travel farther, explored more of the tank, and spent more time in open water (behavioral parameters). Our case study indicates that the two approaches—quantifying movement and behavioral parameters—are broadly equivalent, and we suggest that movement parameters can be viewed as “micropersonality” traits that give rise to broad-scale consistent interindividual differences in behavior. This finding has implications for both personality and movement ecology research areas. For example, the study of movement parameters may provide a robust way to analyze individual personalities in species that are difficult or impossible to study using standardized behavioral assays.},

Insects are among the greatest pests of agriculture, horticulture and forestry worldwide, inflicting damage and economic costs both directly and by transmitting plant viruses. There is a need for tracking the migrant insects in agroecosystems through space and time to establish their migration. Furthermore, tracing the origin of pest insects allows to design more rapid, efficient and environment-friendly control systems (less use of insecticides). Tracking insects can also help us better understanding their biology (e.g. insect population dynamics, geo-traceability, feeding behavior and other ecological interactions). However, tracking insects presents a considerable challenge as they are often small, cryptic and highly mobile organisms. The most common methods of analysis currently proposed (microsatellite markers, stable isotopes) do not allow for the moment to determine their geographical origin. The ecological niche occupied by the insects highly influences the bacterial communities associated with the insects. Hence understanding the diversity of bacterial communities could be an option to trace the orgins of the pest. This paper presents two new protocols used to extract bacterial DNA from the Cotton Bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera and the analysis of this DNA by PCR-DGGE. This promising method is proposed as a new traceability tool which provides insects with a unique biological barcode and makes it possible to trace back the insects to their original location.},

	abstract = {The high temperature conversion (HTC) technique using an elemental analyzer with a glassy carbon tube and filling (temperature conversion/elemental analysis, TC/EA) is a widely used method for hydrogen isotopic analysis of water and many solid and liquid organic samples with analysis by isotope-ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). However, the TC/EA IRMS method may produce inaccurate δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H results, with values deviating by more than 20 mUr (milliurey = 0.001 = 1‰) from the true value for some materials. We show that a single-oven, chromium-filled elemental analyzer coupled to an IRMS substantially improves the measurement quality and reliability for hydrogen isotopic compositions of organic substances (Cr-EA method). Hot chromium maximizes the yield of molecular hydrogen in a helium carrier gas by irreversibly and quantitatively scavenging all reactive elements except hydrogen. In contrast, under TC/EA conditions, heteroelements like nitrogen or chlorine (and other halogens) can form hydrogen cyanide (HCN) or hydrogen chloride (HCl) and this can cause isotopic fractionation. The Cr-EA technique thus expands the analytical possibilities for on-line hydrogen-isotope measurements of organic samples significantly. This method yielded reproducibility values (1-sigma) for δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H measurements on water and caffeine samples of better than 1.0 and 0.5 mUr, respectively. To overcome handling problems with water as the principal calibration anchor for hydrogen isotopic measurements, we have employed an effective and simple strategy using reference waters or other liquids sealed in silver-tube segments. These crimped silver tubes can be employed in both the Cr-EA and TC/EA techniques. They simplify considerably the normalization of hydrogen-isotope measurement data to the VSMOW-SLAP (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water-Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation) scale, and their use improves accuracy of the data by eliminating evaporative loss and associated isotopic fractionation while handling water as a bulk sample. The calibration of organic samples, commonly having high δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H values, will benefit from the availability of suitably $^{\textrm{2}}$H-enriched reference waters, extending the VSMOW-SLAP scale above zero.},

	abstract = {Millions of migratory birds occupy seasonally favourable breeding grounds in the Arctic1, but we know little about the formation, maintenance and future of the migration routes of Arctic birds and the genetic determinants of migratory distance. Here we established a continental-scale migration system that used satellite tracking to follow 56 peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) from 6 populations that breed in the Eurasian Arctic, and resequenced 35 genomes from 4 of these populations. The breeding populations used five migration routes across Eurasia, which were probably formed by longitudinal and latitudinal shifts in their breeding grounds during the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene epoch. Contemporary environmental divergence between the routes appears to maintain their distinctiveness. We found that the gene ADCY8 is associated with population-level differences in migratory distance. We investigated the regulatory mechanism of this gene, and found that long-term memory was the most likely selective agent for divergence in ADCY8 among the peregrine populations. Global warming is predicted to influence migration strategies and diminish the breeding ranges of peregrine populations of the Eurasian Arctic. Harnessing ecological interactions and evolutionary processes to study climate-driven changes in migration can facilitate the conservation of migratory birds.},

Many kinds of insects are now resistant or cross-resistant to pesticides. Tracking studies have become very important for combatting insect pests and for better understanding their biology (eg insect population dynamics, movements, feeding behaviour and other ecological interactions). A wide variety of tracing approaches have been used including discriminative, tracer and molecular methods. The perfect technique for insect tracking is the technique that harmonizes with insects’ ‘normal’ biology. Furthermore, the technique should be environmentally safe, cost-effective and easy to use. This paper reviews the current techniques used for insect traceability, documents the advantages and drawbacks of each method, and puts special focus on molecular techniques, including PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as a new and promising traceability tool that could provide insects with a unique biological barcode and thus make it possible to trace their movements.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopes are widely used to identify trophic interactions and to determine trophic positions of organisms in food webs. Comparative studies have provided general insights into the variation in isotopic composition between consumers and their diet (discrimination factors) in predator–prey and herbivore–plant relationships while other major components of food webs such as host–parasite interactions have been largely overlooked. In this study, we conducted a literature-based comparative analysis using phylogenetically-controlled mixed effects models, accounting for both parasite and host phylogenies, to investigate patterns and potential drivers in Δ13C and Δ15N discrimination factors in metazoan parasitic trophic interactions. Our analysis of 101 parasite–host pairs revealed a large range in Δ13C (–8.2 to 6.5) and Δ15N (–6.7 to 9.0) among parasite species, with no significant overall depletion or enrichment of 13C and 15N in parasites. As previously found in other trophic interactions, we identified a scaling relationship between the host isotopic value and both discrimination factors with Δ13C and Δ15N decreasing with increasing host δ13C and δ15N, respectively. Furthermore, parasite phylogenetic history explained a large fraction ({\textgreater}60\%) of the observed variation in the Δ15N discrimination factor. Our findings suggest that the traditional isotope ecology framework (using an average Δ15N of 3.4‰) applies poorly to parasitic trophic interactions. They further indicate the need for a scaled rather than a fixed trophic discrimination factor framework along gradients of host δ15N. We also identified several conceptual and methodological issues which should to be considered in future research to help integrate parasitic interactions into a holistic isotope ecology framework across diverse trophic interactions.},

This creates challenges for the organism to sort inputs that frequently favor conflicting behaviors. Under these conditions, the nervous system relies on established and flexible hierarchies to produce appropriate behavioral changes. The pteropod mollusc Clione limacina is used as an example to illustrate a variety of behavioral interactions that alter a baseline behavioral activity: slow swimming. The alterations include acceleration within the slow swimming mode, acceleration from the slow to fast swimming modes, whole body withdrawal (and inhibition of swimming), food acquisition behavior (with a feeding motivational state), and a startle locomotory response. These examples highlight different types of interaction between the baseline behavior and the new behaviors that involve external stimuli and two types of internal drives: a modular arousal system and a motivational state. The investigation of hierarchical interactions between behavioral modules is a central theme of integrative neuroethology that focuses on an organismal level of understanding of the neural control of behavior. © The Author 2013.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.5518},
	abstract = {Random forest and similar Machine Learning techniques are already used to generate spatial predictions, but spatial location of points (geography) is often ignored in the modeling process. Spatial auto-correlation, especially if still existent in the crossvalidation residuals, indicates that the predictions are maybe biased, and this is suboptimal. This paper presents a random forest for spatial predictions framework (RFsp) where buffer distances from observation points are used as explanatory variables, thus incorporating geographical proximity effects into the prediction process. The RFsp framework is illustrated with examples that use textbook datasets and apply spatial and spatio-temporal prediction to numeric, binary, categorical, multivariate and spatiotemporal variables. Performance of the RFsp framework is compared with the state-of-the-art kriging techniques using fivefold cross-validation with refitting. The results show that RFsp can obtain equally accurate and unbiased predictions as different versions of kriging. Advantages of using RFsp over kriging are that it needs no rigid statistical assumptions about the distribution and stationarity of the target variable, it is more flexible towards incorporating, combining and extending covariates of different types, and it possibly yields more informative maps characterizing the prediction error. RFsp appears to be especially attractive for building multivariate spatial prediction models that can be used as knowledge engines'' in various geoscience fields. Some disadvantages of RFsp are the exponentially growing computational intensity with increase of calibration data and covariates and the high sensitivity of predictions to input data quality. The key to the success of the RFsp framework might be the training data quality-especially quality of spatial sampling (to minimize extrapolation problems and any type of bias in data), and quality of model validation (to ensure that accuracy is not effected by overfitting). For many data sets, especially those with lower number of points and covariates and close-to-linear relationships, model-based geostatistics can still lead to more accurate predictions than RFsp.},

In parasitology it is a traditional assumption that parasites are typically highly specialized; cospeciation between parasites and hosts is a frequently expressed default expectation. Insect–plant theory has been more concerned with host shifts than with cospeciation, and more with hierarchies among hosts than with extreme specialization. We suggest that the divergent assumptions in the respective fields have hidden a fundamental similarity with an important role for potential as well as actual hosts, and hence for host colonizations via ecological fitting. A common research program is proposed which better prepares us for the challenges from introduced species and global change. Parasites are typically assumed to be highly specialized on their hosts and well adapted to them, yet they frequently colonize new hosts – including humans, causing EIDs. This parasite paradox has caused a growing unease with the traditional assumptions in parasitology, which differ markedly from those in the field of insect–plant studies. We report the results of a workshop where parasitologists and insect–plant researchers met to explore the possibility that the two systems may be more similar than the divergent research traditions suggest, so that a common research program can be developed to better prepare us for future challenges.},

Individuals were markedly invariant in their response to environmental variation, suggesting that the current response may be fixed in this population. Phenotypic plasticity can thus play a central role in tracking environmental change; understanding the limits of plasticity is an important goal for future research.},

In particular, spatial isolation within species and hybridization between them can blur species boundaries and create evolutionary relationships that are inconsistent with a strictly bifurcating tree model. Here, we analyse genome-wide DNA sequence and genetic ancestry variation in Lycaeides butterflies to quantify the effects of admixture and spatial isolation on how biological diversity is organized in this group. We document geographically widespread and pervasive historical admixture, with more restricted recent hybridization. This includes evidence supporting previously known and unknown instances of admixture. The genome composition of admixed individuals varies much more among than within populations, and tree- and genetic ancestry-based analyses indicate that multiple distinct admixed lineages or populations exist. We find that most genetic variants in Lycaeides are rare (minor allele frequency {\textless}0.5\%). Because the spatial and taxonomic distributions of alleles reflect demographic and selective processes since mutation, rare alleles, which are presumably younger than common alleles, were spatially and taxonomically restricted compared with common variants. Thus, we show patterns of genetic variation in this group are multifaceted, and we argue that this complexity challenges simplistic notions concerning the organization of biological diversity into discrete, easily delineated and hierarchically structured entities.},

	doi = {10.2478/ami-2014-0001},
	abstract = {The migration of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in North America has a number of parallels with long-distance bird migration, including the fact that migratory populations of monarchs have larger and more elongated forewings than residents. These characteristics likely serve to optimize flight performance in monarchs, as they also do with birds. A question that has rarely been addressed thus far in birds or monarchs is if and how wing characteristics vary within a migration season. Individuals with superior flight performance should migrate quickly, and/or with minimal stopovers, and these individuals should be at the forefront of the migratory cohort. Conversely, individuals with poor flight performance and/or low endurance would be more likely to fall behind, and these would comprise the latest migrants. Here we examined how the wing morphology of migrating monarchs varies to determine if wing characteristics of early migrants differ from late migrants. We measured forewing area, elongation (length/width), and redness, which has been shown to predict flight endurance in monarchs. Based on a collection of 75 monarchs made one entire season (fall 2010), results showed that the earliest migrants (n = 20) in this cohort had significantly redder and more elongated forewings than the latest migrants (n = 17). There was also a non-significant tendency for early migrants to have larger forewing areas. These results suggest that the pace of migration in monarchs is at least partly dependent on the properties of their wings. Moreover, these data also raise a number of questions about the ultimate fate of monarchs that fall behind},

Thanks to an increasing quantity and availability of soil samples collected at field point locations by various government and/or NGO funded projects, it is now possible to produce detailed pan-African maps of soil nutrients, including micro-nutrients at fine spatial resolutions. In this paper we describe production of a 30 m resolution Soil Information System of the African continent using, to date, the most comprehensive compilation of soil samples (N≈ 150 , 000) and Earth Observation data. We produced predictions for soil pH, organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), total carbon, effective Cation Exchange Capacity (eCEC), extractable—phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), sodium (Na), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn)—silt, clay and sand, stone content, bulk density and depth to bedrock, at three depths (0, 20 and 50 cm) and using 2-scale 3D Ensemble Machine Learning framework implemented in the mlr (Machine Learning in R) package. As covariate layers we used 250 m resolution (MODIS, PROBA-V and SM2RAIN products), and 30 m resolution (Sentinel-2, Landsat and DTM derivatives) images. Our fivefold spatial Cross-Validation results showed varying accuracy levels ranging from the best performing soil pH (CCC = 0.900) to more poorly predictable extractable phosphorus (CCC = 0.654) and sulphur (CCC = 0.708) and depth to bedrock. Sentinel-2 bands SWIR (B11, B12), NIR (B09, B8A), Landsat SWIR bands, and vertical depth derived from 30 m resolution DTM, were the overall most important 30 m resolution covariates. Climatic data images—SM2RAIN, bioclimatic variables and MODIS Land Surface Temperature—however, remained as the overall most important variables for predicting soil chemical variables at continental scale. This publicly available 30-m Soil Information System of Africa aims at supporting numerous applications, including soil and fertilizer policies and investments, agronomic advice to close yield gaps, environmental programs, or targeting of nutrition interventions.},

	abstract = {Long-distance migration can be seen throughout the animal kingdom and can have large impacts on population dynamics and species distributions. The act of migration itself also affects the evolution of a species, as evolutionary forces select for certain characteristics in animals conducting long-distance migration. Monarch butterflies are best known for their annual migration from Canada and the northern United States to central Mexico, but some populations of monarchs have lost the ability to migrate. Previous research found that migratory monarchs had larger, more elongated wings than their non-migratory counterparts and it was hypothesized that these traits were beneficial for migration. However, Bergmann’s rule - which predicts larger body sizes with increasing latitude - could also explain this pattern as migratory populations are found at higher latitudes. To understand the role of wing dimensions in migration, we examined forewing size and shape of migratory and non-migratory monarchs from seven worldwide populations varying in latitude. Results showed that larger forewing size was indeed correlated with migratory status rather than latitude. However, migratory monarchs did not have more elongated forewing shape than non-migratory monarchs across the globe. Our study indicates that size may play a larger role than shape in long-distance migratory capability.},

	abstract = {Mapping aboveground forest biomass is central for assessing the global carbon balance. However, current large-scale maps show strong disparities, despite good validation statistics of their underlying models. Here, we attribute this contradiction to a flaw in the validation methods, which ignore spatial autocorrelation (SAC) in data, leading to overoptimistic assessment of model predictive power. To illustrate this issue, we reproduce the approach of large-scale mapping studies using a massive forest inventory dataset of 11.8 million trees in central Africa to train and validate a random forest model based on multispectral and environmental variables. A standard nonspatial validation method suggests that the model predicts more than half of the forest biomass variation, while spatial validation methods accounting for SAC reveal quasi-null predictive power. This study underscores how a common practice in big data mapping studies shows an apparent high predictive power, even when predictors have poor relationships with the ecological variable of interest, thus possibly leading to erroneous maps and interpretations.},

Strontium (Sr) isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) analysis has emerged as a powerful tracer for determining the provenance of ancient biological materials. However, it is important to characterize 87Sr/86Sr variation across a landscape. We measured the 87Sr/86Sr composition of teeth from present-day, herbivorous rodents (n = 162) sampled from across eastern Beringia to estimate bio-available 87Sr/86Sr values. We compiled these data with the very limited number of previously published 87Sr/86Sr values from the region. We then used this dataset and a machine learning, random-forest regression to predict bio-available 87Sr/86Sr variations across eastern Beringia. As a case study using our new 87Sr/86Sr map (isoscape), we measured the 87Sr/86Sr and oxygen stable isotope values (δ18O) of five radiocarbon-dated steppe bison from eastern Beringia and compared these to our 87Sr/86Sr isoscape and a δ18O isoscape to estimate the probable landscape use of these ancient fauna. Our model and isoscape provide important foundations for a wide range of additional applications, including studies of the paleo-mobility of other fauna, ancient people and present-day fauna in eastern Beringia.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Identifying migratory corridors of animals is essential for their effective protection, yet the exact location of such corridors is often unknown, particularly for elusive animals such as bats. While migrating along the German coastline, Nathusius' pipistrelles (Pipistrellus nathusii) are regularly killed at wind turbines. Therefore, we explored the paths taken on their annual journey. Methods: We used isotope ratio mass spectrometry to measure stable hydrogen and strontium isotope ratios in fur keratin of 59 Nathusius' pipistrelles captured on three offshore islands. Samples were pre-treated before analysis to report exclusively stable isotope ratios of non-exchangeable hydrogen. We generated maps to predict summer origins of bats using isoscape models. Results: Bats were classified as long-distance migrants, mostly originating from Eastern Europe. Hydrogen analysis suggested for some bats a possible Fennoscandian origin, yet additional information from strontium analysis excluded this possibility. Instead, our data suggest that most Nathusius' pipistrelles migrating along the German coastline were of continental European summer origin, but also highlight the possibility that Nathusius' pipistrelles of Baltorussian origin may travel offshore from Fennoscandia to Germany. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the benefit of using complementary isotopic tracers for analysing the migratory pathways of bats and also potentially other terrestrial vertebrate species. Furthermore, data from our study suggest an offset of fur strontium isotope ratios in relation to local bedrock.},

Random forest is a non-parametric ensemble approach, and unlike traditional regression approaches there is no direct quantification of prediction error. Understanding prediction uncertainty is important when using model-based continuous maps as inputs to other modeling applications such as fire modeling. Here we use a Monte Carlo approach to quantify prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models. We test the approach by simulating maps of dependent and independent variables with known characteristics and comparing actual errors with prediction errors. Our approach produced conservative prediction intervals across most of the range of predicted values. However, because the Monte Carlo approach was data driven, prediction intervals were either too wide or too narrow in sparse parts of the prediction distribution. Overall, our approach provides reasonable estimates of prediction uncertainty for random forest regression models.},

	abstract = {Environmental data may be "large" due to number of records, number of covariates, or both. Random forests has a reputation for good predictive performance when using many covariates with nonlinear relationships, whereas spatial regression, when using reduced rank methods, has a reputation for good predictive performance when using many records that are spatially autocorrelated. In this study, we compare these two techniques using a data set containing the macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) at 1859 stream sites with over 200 landscape covariates. A primary application is mapping MMI predictions and prediction errors at 1.1 million perennial stream reaches across the conterminous United States. For the spatial regression model, we develop a novel transformation procedure that estimates Box-Cox transformations to linearize covariate relationships and handles possibly zeroinflated covariates. We find that the spatial regression model with transformations, and a subsequent selection of significant covariates, has cross-validation performance comparable to random forests. We also find that prediction interval coverage is close to nominal for each method, but that spatial regression prediction intervals tend to be narrower and have less variability than quantile regression forest prediction intervals. A simulation study is used to generalize results and clarify advantages of each modeling approach.},

Large natural differences in the isotopic signatures of commercially available sugars render them novel markers for mass-reared insects. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.; Caryophyllales: Amaranthaceae), a C3 plant, has a stable isotopic signature (a measure of the ratio of the stable isotopes 13C:12C) of around -27‰ relative to Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB; the international C isotope standard for the stable isotopes, 13C and 12C), and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.; Poales: Poaceae), a C4 plant, has an isotopic signature of around -11‰. Thus by means of such a distinct isotope ratio in the sugar in the diet, mass-reared insects can be easily distinguished from wild insects with a high degree of certainty. It was shown that the method could be extended using a multiple isotope approach, with 15N or a full suite of C, N, S and O isotopes. Intrinsic isotope marking of mass-reared moths proved to be an accurate means of distinguishing wild from mass-reared populations, based on isotopic differences between the wild host plant species and the diets used in mass-rearing, which where possible, had been manipulated to contain the isotopically divergent sugar type. This intrinsic labeling using stable isotopes could be useful in the assessment of the quality of mass-reared moths, because a stable isotope is a marker that does not affect the insect in any detrimental manner.},

Mixed species groups of mammals occur in many different habitats, e.g. ungulates on the savannah, primates in various types of forests and cetaceans in the oceans. Mixed species groups are very different in their duration, frequency, predominant activity and structure depending on the species interacting and the habitat they occur in. Functional explanations for mixed species groups usually fall within two categories: foraging advantages and predator avoidance. However, there could also be other social and reproductive advantages of mixed species groups that could contribute to their formation and stability. The advantages do not have to be equally distributed between the participating species and can also vary according to season and the presence of predators. It is important that all investigators of mixed species groups take their studies one step further after the naturalistic description and test the function and benefits of mixed species groups in order to give more strength to their conclusions. In this paper we review and discuss the function of mixed species groups in mammals and suggest an approach on how to investigate the function of such groups.},

The formation of mixed-species troops is an integral part of the biology of several species of this subfamily. Niche separation between associated species is obtained through vertical segregation which results in differences in the prey spectrum. The degree of niche separation is a predictor for the stability of mixedspecies troops. Individuals may benefit from the formation of mixed-species troops through increased safety from predators, increased foraging effciency, and or increased resource defence. Costs of mixed-species troop formation are probably very low and mainly relate to patterns of interspecific behavioural interactions.

	abstract = {Throughout many regions of the tropics, non-primate animals - mainly birds and mammals - have been observed to follow primate groups and to exploit dropped food and flushed prey. The anecdotal nature of most of the numerous reports on these primate-non-primate associations (PNPAs) may obscure the biological significance of such associations. We review the existing literature and test predictions concerning the influence of primate traits (body size, activity patterns, dietary strategies, habitat, group size) on the occurrence of PNPAs. Furthermore, we examine the influence of non-primates' dietary strategies on the occurrence of PNPAs, and the distribution of benefits and costs. We detected a strong signal in the geographic distribution of PNPAs, with a larger number of such associations in the Neotropics compared to Africa and Asia. Madagascar lacks PNPAs altogether. Primate body size, activity patterns, habitat and dietary strategies as well as non-primate dietary strategies affect the occurrence of PNPAs, while primate group size did not play a role. Benefits are asymmetrically distributed and mainly accrue to non-primates. They consist of foraging benefits through the consumption of dropped leaves and fruits and flushed prey, and anti-predation benefits through eavesdropping on primate alarm calls and vigilance. Where quantitative information is available, it has been shown that benefits for non-primates can be substantial. The majority of PNPAs can thus be categorized as cases of commensalism, while mutualism is very rare. Our review provides evidence that the ecological function of primates extends beyond their manifold interactions with plants, but may remain underestimated.},

While mixed-species associations are common among mammals, those involving carnivorous predators and potential prey species are seldom reported. On the Guassa Plateau, in the Ethiopian highlands, we observed solitary Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) foraging for rodents among grazing gelada monkey (Theropithecus gelada) herds. The tolerant and sometimes prolonged ({\textgreater} 1 h) associations contrasted with the defensive behaviors exhibited by geladas toward other potential predators. Ethiopian wolves spent a higher proportion of time foraging and preyed more successfully on rodents when among geladas than when alone, providing evidence that gelada herds increase the vulnerability of subterranean rodents to predation. Ethiopian wolves appear to habituate gelada herds to their presence through nonthreatening behavior, thereby foregoing opportunistic foraging opportunities upon vulnerable juvenile geladas in order to feed more effectively on rodents. For Ethiopian wolves, establishing proximity to geladas as foraging commensals could be an adaptive strategy to elevate foraging success. The novel dynamics documented here shed light on the ecological circumstances that contribute to the stability of mixed groups of predators and potential prey.},

However, the use of this isotope to infer diet and potentially trophic position remains poorly understood, especially in non-aquatic terrestrial ecosystems. In many animal communities, tissue δ15N values are strongly associated with trophic position. Correlations between tissue δ2H and δ15N are expected, then, if δ2H is affected by trophic enrichment of 2H. In addition, within sites, we would expect higher tissue δ2H values in insectivorous species compared to granivores or nectarivores. We tested these hypotheses for two resident avian communities in Nigeria consisting of 30 species representing a range of dietary guilds (granivores, frugivores, nectarivores, omnivores, insectivores) by comparing feather δ2H, δ15N and δ13C values. We found considerable isotopic overlap among all guilds except granivores, with no clear pattern of enrichment in 2H with trophic position. However, at one of our sites (open scrubland), feather δ2H was positively correlated with feather δ15N (R2 = 0.30) compared to a closed canopy forest site (R2 = 0.09). Our results indicate weak evidence for predictable trophic enrichment in 2H in terrestrial environments and indicate that controlled studies are now required to definitively elucidate the behavior of H isotopes in terrestrial food webs.},

	abstract = {Researchers seeking to generate genomic data for non-model organisms are faced with a number of trade-offs when deciding which method to use. The selection of reduced representation approaches versus whole genome re-sequencing will ultimately affect the marker density, sequencing depth, and the number of individuals that can multiplexed. These factors can affect researchers’ ability to accurately characterize certain genomic features, such as landscapes of divergence—how FST varies across the genomes. To provide insight into the effect of sequencing method on the estimation of divergence landscapes, we applied an identical bioinformatic pipeline to three generations of sequencing data (GBS, ddRAD, and WGS) produced for the same system, the yellow-rumped warbler species complex. We compare divergence landscapes generated using each method for the myrtle warbler (Setophaga coronata coronata) and the Audubon’s warbler (S. c. auduboni), and for Audubon’s warblers with deeply divergent mtDNA resulting from mitochondrial introgression. We found that most high-FST peaks were not detected in the ddRAD dataset, and that while both GBS and WGS were able to identify the presence of large peaks, WGS was superior at a finer scale. Comparing Audubon’s warblers with divergent mitochondrial haplotypes, only WGS allowed us to identify small (10-20kb) regions of elevated differentiation, one of which contained the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial gene NDUFAF3. We calculated the cost per base pair for each method and found it was comparable between GBS and WGS, but significantly higher for ddRAD. These comparisons highlight the advantages of WGS over reduced representation methods when characterizing landscapes of divergence.},

While the role of recombination in the evolution of sex has received theoretical and empirical attention, less is known about how recombination rate itself evolves and what influence this has on evolutionary processes within sexually reproducing organisms. Here, we explore the patterns of, and processes governing recombination in eukaryotes. We summarize patterns of variation, integrating current knowledge with an analysis of linkage map data in 353 organisms. We then discuss proximate and ultimate processes governing recombination rate variation and consider how these influence evolutionary processes. Genome-wide recombination rates (cM/Mb) can vary more than tenfold across eukaryotes, and there is large variation in the distribution of recombination events across closely related taxa, populations and individuals. We discuss how variation in rate and distribution relates to genome architecture, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, sex, environmental perturbations and variable selective pressures. There has been great progress in determining the molecular mechanisms governing recombination, and with the continued development of newmodelling and empirical approaches, there is now also great opportunity to further our understanding of how and why recombination rate varies.},

Here we use the well-known colour pattern genotypes of the African monarch or queen (Danaus chrysippus), which also control wing length, to test these effects both in the laboratory and in a contact zone in the field. By measuring the wing lengths in animals of known colour pattern genotype we show clear evidence for all three hybrid effects at the A and BC colour patterning loci, and importantly, that these same effects persist in the same presumptive F1s when measured in hybrid populations in the field. This demonstrates the power of a system in which genotypes can be directly inferred in the field and highlights that all three hybrid effects can be seen in the East African contact zone of this fascinating butterfly.},

Our data suggest an important role for nuclear hormone receptors early in metamorphosis, whereas PAS-domain transcription factors are strongly associated with later chromatin opening. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) validation of select candidate factors showed spineless binding to be a major predictor of opening chromatin. Surprisingly, binding of ecdysone receptor (EcR), a candidate accessibility factor in Drosophila, was not predictive of opening but instead marked persistent sites.

Here we combine chromatin assays, DNA sequence associations, and genome editing to functionally characterize 5 cis-regulatory elements of the color pattern gene optix. We were surprised to find that the cis-regulatory architecture of optix is characterized by pleiotropy and regulatory fragility, where deletion of individual cis-regulatory elements has broad effects on both color pattern and wing vein development. Remarkably, we found orthologous cis-regulatory elements associate with wing pattern convergence of distantly related comimics, suggesting that parallel coevolution of ancestral elements facilitated pattern mimicry.

The idea of a speciation continuum provides something of a solution to this problem; rather than observing the entire process, we can simply reconstruct it from the multitude of speciation events that surround us. But what do we really mean when we talk about the speciation continuum, and can it really help us understand speciation? We explored these questions using a literature review and online survey of speciation researchers. Although most researchers were familiar with the concept and thought it was useful, our survey revealed extensive disagreement about what the speciation continuum actually tells us. This is due partly to the lack of a clear definition. Here, we provide an explicit definition that is compatible with the Biological Species Concept. That is, the speciation continuum is a continuum of reproductive isolation. After outlining the logic of the definition in light of alternatives, we explain why attempts to reconstruct the speciation process from present-day populations will ultimately fail. We then outline how we think the speciation continuum concept can continue to act as a foundation for understanding the continuum of reproductive isolation that surrounds us.},

For comparison, we also examined the genomes of two close relatives: the Andean condor (\textit{Vultur gryphus}; Vulnerable$^{\textrm{3}}$) and the turkey vulture (\textit{Cathartes aura}; Least Concern$^{\textrm{3}}$). The genomes of all three species show evidence of historic population declines. Interestingly, the California condor genome retains a high degree of variation, which our analyses reveal is a legacy of its historically high abundance. Correlations between genome-wide diversity and recombination rate further suggest a history of purifying selection against linked deleterious alleles, boding well for future restoration. We show how both long-term evolutionary forces and recent inbreeding have shaped the genome of the California condor, and provide crucial genomic resources to enable future research and conservation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here we show that despite a strong selective advantage when they form, inversions accumulate recessive deleterious mutations that generate frequency-dependent selection and promote their maintenance at intermediate frequency. Combining genomics and in vivo fitness analyses in a model butterfly for wing-pattern polymorphism, Heliconius numata, we reveal that three ecologically advantageous inversions have built up a heavy mutational load from the sequential accumulation of deleterious mutations and transposable elements. Inversions associate with sharply reduced viability when homozygous, which prevents them from replacing ancestral chromosome arrangements. Our results suggest that other complex polymorphisms, rather than representing adaptations to competing ecological optima, could evolve because chromosomal rearrangements are intrinsically prone to carrying recessive harmful mutations.},

However, parasite–host isotopic relationships remain unclear, with Δ13C and Δ15N remaining incompletely characterized, especially for helminths. In this study, we used stable isotopes to determine discrimination factors for 13 parasite–host pairings of helminths in coral reef fish. Differences in Δ15N values grouped according to parasite groups and habitat within the host with positive Δ15N values observed for trematodes and nematodes from the digestive tract and variable Δ15N values observed for cestodes and nematodes from the general cavity. Furthermore, Δ13C values showed more complex patterns with no effect of parasite group or habitat within host. A negative relationship was observed between Δ15N and host δ15N values among different host-parasite pairings as well as within 7 out of the 13 pairings, indicating that host metabolic processing affects host-parasite discrimination values. In contrast, no relationships were observed for Δ13C values. Our results indicate that parasite group, habitat within host, and host stable isotope value drive Δ15N of helminths in coral reef fish while their effect on Δ13C is more idiosyncratic.

Captive rearing of monarch butterflies is a popular and widely used approach for both public education and conservation. However, recent evidence suggests that captive-reared monarchs may lose their capacity to orient southward during fall migration to their Mexican overwintering sites, raising questions about the value and ethics of this activity undertaken by tens of thousands of North American citizens, educators, volunteers and conservationists each year. We raised offspring of wild-caught monarchs on swamp milkweed (Asclepias incarnata) indoors at 29°C during the day and 23°C at night ({\textasciitilde}77\% RH, 18L:6D), and after eclosion, individuals were either tested in a flight simulator or radio tracked in the wild using an array of automated telemetry towers. While 26\% (10/39) of monarchs tested in the flight simulator showed a weakly concentrated southward orientation, 97\% (28/29) of the radio-tracked individuals that could be reliably detected by automated towers flew in a south to southeast direction from the release site and were detected at distances of up to 200 km away.

	abstract = {Ants due to their nesting habits are ideal for studying temporal fluctuations in trace metal accumulation, changes in morphological traits, as well as for assessing evolutionary processes and monitoring environmental impact of metals derived from human activities. Although metal pollution may affect basic ecological traits such as colony size and survival, ants can be considered relatively resistant to metal pollution at least partly due to relatively high metal regulation efficiency. At both polluted and unpolluted areas the body metal levels in ants vary considerably between species. This observation and other experimental data suggest differences in metal regulation physiology, however the physiological basis of these differences remains unknown. It was shown that metal pollution may suppress the immune defense systems, which in turn could theoretically lead to a higher risk of infections. Biodiversity studies are limited, however the evidence for a clear negative influence of metal pollution on ant species diversity and abundance was not yet provided. Since many aspects of ant ecotoxicology remain unclear, the questions for possible future research are suggested. © 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

More sophisticated geochemical methods and isotopic tracing especially for lead (Pb) may or may not provide definitive answers. We suggest that relatively simple approaches using the microscopic techniques of optical microscopy complemented by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive analyses along with X-ray diffraction can provide definitive answers to the conundrum. Heavy liquid and –53 + 48 µm fractions of soil, pavement and gutter sweepings, dust depositional gauges, long-term dust accumulation, vacuum cleaner dust and ceiling dust were investigated using the above methods. The most common Pb-bearing particles consisted of Pb, Fe, Mn, Al, Si and O. The majority of grains were rounded with cavities and overgrowths, and showed evidence of transport and recrystallisation, probably deriving from post-mining activities and/or earlier geological processes. A small number of samples from ceiling dust, pavement sweepings, vacuum cleaner dust and long-term dust accumulation contained galena with a high degree of crystallinity suggesting a derivation from recent mining and ore concentration activities. High-precision Pb isotopic analyses showed that some samples with extensive oxidation and weathering had absorbed Pb from sources other than mine Pb, and these could be from gasoline, paint or weathering of the country rocks.},

Five stations (each with two hives) were selected and samples were collected from May to July of 2007, 2009 and 2010. Concentrations of Pb, Cr, Ni and Cd in nectar were determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Substantial spatial and temporal differences were detected and compared with the values found in bee bodies in a previously published study based on samples obtained simultaneously with those presented in this work. Upper reference thresholds established for this investigation were surpassed frequently by the measures obtained, being Cr (21.43\% of samples), stations S3 (22.22\%) and S4 (11.12\%) year 2009 (22.22\%) and the month of July (23.68\%) the metal, the locations and the periods that exceeded more times these references. Regarding the Cd, which was studied only in 2010, 33.33\% of the nectar samples exceeded the upper reference thresholds. Comparing the biomonitoring of bee bodies and nectar, some coincidences were found, although they showed different results for highest worrisome values of metal, station and year.

	abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) is a heavy metal that is of great concern in the agroecosystem, because of its toxicity to plants and herbivores. Previous research has suggested that populations of herbivorous insects can be affected by Cd, via disrupting tri-trophic interactions comprising plants, herbivores, and predators. However, there is less understanding of the direct effects of dietary Cd on the life history traits and the detoxification or antioxidant enzyme systems of insects. Here we show that the life history traits of the herbivorous oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Walker), can be impacted by Cd. The body mass of larvae was decreased under an artificial diet containing a low (0.15 mg kg-1) Cd concentration, but was increased by intermediate (0.30 mg kg-1) and high (0.60 mg kg-1) concentrations of Cd. In contrast, pupal weight declined under intermediate and high concentrations of Cd compared to either low Cd concentration or the control. When Cd concentrations increased, larvae survival rate and fecundity decreased and the pupation rate and pupal deformity rate increased. Low and intermediate concentrations of Cd extended the length of the larval stage while high concentrations of Cd shortened the larval period. Dietary Cd inhibited the activity of antioxidant enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO), but increased acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and the activities of detoxifying enzymes carboxylesterase (CarE) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) of third-instar larvae. Overall, our results indicate that for Cd concentration there is a physiological trade-off between its adverse effects on life history traits and elevated detoxification, acetylcholinesterase sensitivity and antioxidation of M. separata, thus representing a potential adaptation strategy.},

In this study, the biochemical effects of dietary cadmium (Cd) on the activities of GST and CarE in different developmental stages of the rice grasshopper Oxya chinensis Thunberg were studied. The results showed that the effects of the Cd concentration and developmental stage on GST activity were statistically significant. GST activity in O. chinensis increased at the highest Cd concentration in most nymphs, suggesting that GST is typically inducible by Cd. However, GST activity was inhibited in adults under Cd stress owing to life-stagespecific physiological characteristics. The results showed that the substrates, developmental stage, and Cd concentration had statistically significant effects on CarE activity. In most studies of CarE activity, the interaction between any two studied factors was statistically significant, although the interaction effects of the substrates, developmental stages, and Cd concentrations were not significant, which implied that the insect physiological condition and the external environmental may affect CarE activity. The results suggest that the insect's life stage and enzyme substrates should be considered when enzyme activity under Cd stress is studied. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

During the production of insects, substrate quality is a key parameter to assure optimal insect biomass gain as well as the safety of feed and food derived from commercially reared insects. Therefore, the influence of a realistic substrate contamination scenario on growth performance and accumulation behaviour of black soldier fly larvae (BSFL; Hermetia illucens L.) was investigated. Newly hatched larvae were fed on a corn-based substrate spiked with heavy metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb), mycotoxins (aflatoxins B1/B2/G2, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, zearalenone) and pesticides (chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos-methyl, pirimiphos-methyl) under defined breeding conditions (10 days, 28°C, 67\% relative humidity). The extent of contaminants’ bioaccumulation in the larval tissue as well as the effect on growing determinants were examined. The applied heavy metal substrate contamination was shown to impair larval growing indicated by significantly lower post-trial larval mass and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Cd and Pb accumulation factors of 9 and 2, respectively, were determined, while the concentrations of other heavy metals in the larvae remained below the initial substrate concentration. In contrast, mycotoxins and pesticides have neither been accumulated in the larval tissue nor significantly affected the growing determinants in comparison with the control. The use of BSFL as livestock feed requires contaminant monitoring–especially for Cd and Pb–in the substrates as well as in feedstuff containing BSFL to ensure feed and food safety along the value chain.},

The results showed that feeding on Cd or Pb stressed poplar leaves significantly decreased L. dispar larval weights, body lengths and head capsule widths, pupal weights and female fecundity, and delayed the duration of larval development. Similar effects from the Zn stressed poplar leaves were also observed on all the above mentioned variables except male pupal weight and larval development duration that showed no differences from the control. Cd, Zn, or Pb stressed poplar leaves had no significant effects on L. dispar larval survival, pupation and emergence rates; in fact, both larval survival and pupation rates reached 100\%. These results suggest that Cd, Zn or Pb stress in P. alba berolinensis might help the trees defend against the defoliator, however; L. dispar may in turn have an effective detoxification mechanism for lessening the effects of plant-mediated defenses and heavy metals in leaves on larval survival, pupation and eclosion.},

We fed gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.) paper birch leaves (Betula papyrifera Marsh) (Fagales: Betulaceae) collected from four forested catchment areas near an abandoned Cu/Ni smelter in Sudbury (Ontario, Canada) with different histories of industrial degradation and remediation (reference, remediated, natural recovery, and degraded). We measured caterpillar feeding, frass properties and decomposability, and the effects of frass on the growth of ticklegrass (Agrostis scabra Willd.) (Poales: Poaceae). Caterpillars generally ate more (+25-50\%) and produced more frass (+30-40 \%) on a diet of leaves from the more industrially degraded sites. Frass had an overall positive effect on plant survivorship (+4.1-10.8 effect size) and growth (+0.1-0.5 effect size), although the smallest benefits came from frass derived from vegetation from the more heavily degraded sites. Our results suggest that defoliating insects respond to differences in environmental degradation and remediation and that industrial landscapes may be particularly susceptible to more extensive defoliation and increased conversion of foliar biomass into frass, which could alter plant growth and survivorship, soil development, and nutrient and metal cycling. Some of these effects may pose additional challenges to landscape recovery (e.g., increased defoliation) while others may be beneficial (e.g., enhanced plant growth and soil development).},

The uptake of heavy metals could influence the growth of BSFL, but the effects of heavy metal pressures on the gut microbiota of BSFL are largely uncharacterized. Here, we examine the influences of Cu and Cd on the growth and gut microbiota of BSFL as well as the distribution of accumulated heavy metals in the larvae and their feces. Exposure to Cu (from 100 to 800 mg/kg) and Cd (from 10 to 80 mg/kg) did not significantly inhibit the weight gain of BSFL. With elevated exposure doses, the contents of both Cu and Cd accumulated in the bodies and feces of BSFL were remarkably increased. In the BSFL feces, Cu mainly existed as residues, while Cd mainly existed as either water-soluble states (in the low-exposure groups) or residues (in the high-exposure groups). Cd was more readily enriched (47.1\%–91.3\%) than Cu ({\textless}30\%) in vivo. More importantly, exposure to Cu and Cd remarkably altered the gut microbiota of BSFL, particularly in the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. High exposure to the metals (i.e., Cu-800 and Cd-80 groups) substantially decreased the abundances of most of the dominant families, but significantly stimulated the enrichment of Brucellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Alcaligenaceae, Campylobacteraceae, and Enterococcaceae. Moreover, the bacterial diversity in the BSFL gut was significantly reduced following high exposure to the metals. These results may fill a gap in our knowledge of the effects of heavy metals on the intestinal microbiome of BSFL.},

The effects of Zn stress on the survival, growth and food utilization of S. litura were also determined. Zn concentrations in the body (larvae, pupae, and adults), faeces, exuviates, puparium, eggs increased with the increasing Zn concentrations in the diets, while Zn excretion and accumulation by S. litura in 750 mg/kg Zn treatments was lower than the 600 mg/kg Zn treatment. In the 450 mg/kg Zn treatment, the Zn accumulation in S. litura at different developmental stages differed as follows: larvae {\textgreater} pupa {\textgreater} adult. S. litura ingested Zn via feeding and could excrete most of the Zn via faeces (compared with Zn excretion via exuviates) to reduce its internal Zn accumulation (compared with Zn ingestion). Survival and weight were significantly inhibited, and the prolonged period of development (larvae, pupae) and shortened longevity of adults were found in S. litura exposed to Zn stress greater than 450 mg Zn/kg. In the 150–450 mg/kg Zn treatments, the 6th instar larvae increased their relative consumption rate (RCR) and approximate digestibility (AD) (namely, food eaten) to gain weight, which resulted in greater Zn accumulation in the body. Therefore, below the threshold level (being close to 450 mg/kg Zn), S. litura seemed to have a strong homeostatic adjustment ability (increase the amount of food eaten, thereby increasing AD, RCR and Zn excretion via faeces and exuviates) to sustain their weight, and Zn was beneficial and harmless. Although larvae treated with 750 mg/kg Zn had a similar RCR and AD as the control, a reduced weight gain and prolonged larval period resulted in significantly lower relative growth rate (RGR), which indicated surviving insects may allocate more energy from foods for detoxification than for growth.},

Heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) accumulate in the food chain and may lead to detrimental effects on the physiological functions of living organisms, including herbivorous insects. One such example is the Asian Corn Borer, Ostrinia furnacalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). However, how Cd can affect the development and reproduction of O. furnacalis is largely unknown. In this study, we exposed larvae of O. furnacalis to a diet containing Cd and investigated the effects of Cd on the development, mating behavior, and fecundity of the insect. We showed that Cd accumulates in the larvae and inhibits development by extending larval and pupal duration and decreasing the survival rate. The excretion of Cd through multiple routes during the larval and pupal stages resulted in low levels of residual Cd in the adult insects, which were not fed with Cd. However, the mating behavior and fecundity of these insects were significantly affected, compared to control insects. This suggests that the bioaccumulation of heavy metals such as Cd has long lasting and detrimental effects on O. furnacalis over the entire life cycle, affecting fecundity, even when specimens are only exposed at an early life stage.},

	abstract = {Biochemical and physiological effects of prolonged feeding of the ant Formica aquilonia, in natural conditions with excess of cadmium or mercury, were studied. In all developmental stages metals caused the time-dependent increase of AMP, parallel with a decrease of ATP and the pool size of adenylates. This was reflected by a low adenylate energy charge (AEC) index and accompanied by an inhibition of ATPases. Despite the fall in the adenylate pool of workers, the levels of adenylate energy charge confirmed their ability to maintain energetic balance. Prolonged access to food highly contaminated with Cd or Cd with Hg, diminished these adaptive abilities, but pre-adaptive reactions (not correlated with the metal load) were induced. Activity patterns of enzymes involved in energy metabolism showed metal dependent inhibitory effects, but repeated contamination evoked some compensatory mechanisms, both in workers and in the pupal stage from the next generations. Cadmium (indirectly) stimulated the esterases and free radical scavengers. Compensatory mechanisms were insufficient in insects contaminated with both Hg and Cd, even causing family disappearance, through increased mortality and migration to other colonies. Compensatory mechanisms expressed by the adult workers appeared to be of a phenotypic origin.},

A slight increase in Cd levels will threaten the health of terrestrial and aquatic organisms. Therefore, Cd contamination and its effects on the ecosystems and organisms have become a major topic of eco-toxicological research. The present study investigated the eco-toxicological effects of Cd-supplemented diet on some life history traits and specific enzyme activities of carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s) in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera. The results showed that Cd significantly decreased larval survival, pupation and emergence, and reduced body mass of the sixth instar larvae, pupae, adult moths and female fecundity. Cd-supplemented diet also delayed the development of larvae and pupae and shortened the life span of the cotton bollworm moth. In addition, dietary Cd inhibited the activities of GST, CarE and P450, but increased AChE activity of the sixth instar larvae. We concluded that life history traits and metabolic enzymes are sensitive to Cd stress in the cotton bollworm. These parameters are potential biomarkers for monitoring environmental stress in Lepidopteran insect pests.},

	abstract = {The uptake of metals from food and water sources by insects is thought to be additive. For a given metal, the proportions taken up from water and food will depend both on the bioavailable concentration of the metal associated with each source and the mechanism and rate by which the metal enters the insect. Attempts to correlate insect trace metal concentrations with the trophic level of insects should be made with a knowledge of the feeding relationships of the individual taxa concerned. Pathways for the uptake of essential metals, such as copper and zinc, exist at the cellular level, and other nonessential metals, such as cadmium, also appear to enter via these routes. Within cells, trace metals can be bound to proteins or stored in granules. The internal distribution of metals among body tissues is very heterogeneous, and distribution patterns tend to be both metal and taxon specific. Trace metals associated with insects can be both bound on the surface of their chitinous exoskeleton and incorporated into body tissues. The quantities of trace meals accumulated by an individual reflect the net balance between the rate of metal influx from both dissolved and particulate sources and the rate of metal efflux from the organism. The toxicity of metals has been demonstrated at all levels of biological organization: cell, tissue, individual, population, and community. Much of the literature pertaining to the toxic effects of metals on aquatic insects is based on laboratory observations and, as such, it is difficult to extrapolate the data to insects in nature. The few experimental studies in nature suggest that trace metal contaminants can affect both the distribution and the abundance of aquatic insects. Insects have a largely unexploited potential as biomonitors of metal contamination in nature. A better understanding of the physico-chemical and biological mechanisms mediating trace metal bioavailability and exchange will facilitate the development of general predictive models relating trace metal concentrations in insects to those in their environment. Such models will facilitate the use of insects as contaminant biomonitors. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

To date, limited information is available on the safety of insects, and toxic elements are one of the potential hazards of concern. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential accumulation of cadmium, lead and arsenic in larvae of two insect species, Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworm) and Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), which seem to hold potential as a source of food or feed. An experiment was designed with 14 treatments, each in triplicate, per insect species. Twelve treatments used feed that was spiked with cadmium, lead or arsenic at 0.5, 1 and 2 times the respective maximum allowable levels (ML) in complete feed, as established by the European Commission (EC). Two of the 14 treatments consisted of controls, using non-spiked feed. All insects per container (replicate) were harvested when the first larva in that container had completed its larval stage. Development time, survival rates and fresh weights were similar over all treatments, except for development time and total live weight of the half of the maximum limit treatment for cadmium of the black soldier fly. Bioaccumulation (bioaccumulation factor {\textgreater} 1) was seen in all treatments (including two controls) for lead and cadmium in black soldier fly larvae, and for the three arsenic treatments in the yellow mealworm larvae. In the three cadmium treatments, concentrations of cadmium in black soldier fly larvae are higher than the current EC maximum limit for feed materials. The same was seen for the 1.0 and 2.0 ML treatments of arsenic in the yellow mealworm larvae. From this study, it can be concluded that if insects are used as feed materials, the maximum limits of these elements in complete feed should be revised per insect species.},

We also analyzed Pb in insects which feed in the polluted forest vegetation and litter. Assessment of high Pb loads causing potential ecological risk to insects was also studied. Total Pb pool in the vegetation was 0.12 g m −2 and annual litterfall deposition flux of Pb was 13.42 mg m −2 , which was much higher than those in the background areas. Pools of Pb from litter to mineral topsoil averaged 4.3 g m −2 , which accounted for 97.3\% of total pools (biomass + soil) in the forest ecosystem. Pools of Pb in surface soils were correlated significantly with the pools of total organic matter and elevation. Atmospheric deposition was inferred the major source of Pb in the forest ecosystem, which can be supported by the highest Pb concentrations in the moss and overstory foliage. The maximum Pb concentration was showed in the dung beetle (12.1 mg kg −1 ) residing in the soils compared that in the longicorn and of cicada, which would potentially pose negatively influence to predators along food chains.},

	volume = {Ph.D. Thes},
	abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

This study investigated the heavy metal-accumulation and excretion in, and food utilization of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) larvae that were fed with leaves plucked from poplar seedlings (Populus alba berolinensis) grown in either noncontaminated soil (control), Zn-contaminated soil (500mg/kg), or Pb-contaminated soil (500mg/kg). Our results showed that excretion of heavy metals via insect feces and exuvia is an effective approach to reduce the internal Zn and Pb concentrations, and result in the decrease of Zn and Pb concentrations in the gypsy moth larvae with the increased larval age. In addition, the gypsy moth larvae seemed to have a strong homeostatic adjustment mechanism [between approximate digestibility (AD) and efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD)] that maintains a stable level of "efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI)" regardless of heavy metal (Zn or Pb) contaminations or not, except the fifth instar larvae in which the increase in AD was insufficient to compensate for the decrease of ECD. These results suggest that heavy metal excretions could help the gypsy moth larvae cope with Zn or Pb stress, and the increased digestion of food could meet their energy requirements for both detoxification and growth. However, further increase in Zn or Pb exposure time seemed to inhibit the larval food utilization.},

While the presence of Al in nectar did not influence foraging patterns by bumblebees, flowers containing Ni nectar solutions were visited for shorter time periods relative to controls, and discouraged bees from visiting nearby Ni-contaminated flowers. However, because bumblebees still visited these flowers, they likely ingested a potentially toxic resource.

	abstract = {Organismal tolerance to environmental pollution is thought to be constrained by fitness costs, where variants with higher survival in polluted environments have lower performance in nonpolluted environments. Yet, costs are not always detected in empirical studies. One hypothesis suggests that whether tolerance costs emerge depends on the degree of heterogeneity populations experience with respect to pollution exposure. For instance, in populations confined to local environments where pollution is persistent, selection may favour alleles that enhance pollution tolerance but reduce performance in nonpolluted environments (costs). However, in broadly distributed populations that undergo selection in both polluted and nonpolluted patches, costs should be eroded. Understanding tolerance costs in broadly distributed populations is relevant to management of invasive species, which are highly dispersive, wide ranging, and often colonize disturbed or polluted patches such as agricultural monocultures. Therefore, we conducted a case study quantifying costs of tolerance to zinc pollution (a common heavy metal pollutant) in wild cabbage white butterflies (Pieris rapae). This wide ranging, highly dispersive and invasive pest periodically encounters metal pollution by consuming plants in urban and agricultural settings. In contrast to expected costs of tolerance, we found that cabbage white families with greater zinc tolerance also produced more eggs and had higher reproductive effort under nonpolluted conditions. These results contribute to a more general hypothesis of why costs of pollution tolerance vary across studies: patchy selection with pollutants should erode costs and may favour genotypes that perform well under both polluted and nonpolluted conditions. This might partly explain why widely distributed invasive species are able to thrive in diverse, polluted and nonpolluted habitats.},

For example, bees are exposed to the metalloid selenate when foraging on pollen and nectar from plants growing in contaminated soils. As it has been shown that the microbiome of animals reduces metalloid toxicity, we assayed the ability of the bee microbiome to increase survivorship against selenate challenge. We exposed uninoculated or microbiota-inoculated Bombus impatiens workers to a field-realistic dose of 0.75 mg l−1 selenate and found that microbiota-inoculated bees survive slightly but significantly longer than uninoculated bees. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that selenate exposure altered gut microbial community composition and relative abundance of specific core bacteria. We also grew two core bumble bee microbes – Snodgrassella alvi and Lactobacillus bombicola – in selenate-spiked media and found that these bacteria grew in the tested concentrations of 0.001–10 mg l−1 selenate. Furthermore, the genomes of these microbes harbour genes involved in selenate detoxification. The bumble bee microbiome slightly increases survivorship when the host is exposed to selenate, but the specific mechanisms and colony-level benefits under natural settings require further study.},

	abstract = {Aluminum is increasingly globally bioavailable with acidification from industrial emissions and poor mining practices. This bioavailability increases uptake by flora, contaminating products such as fruit, pollen, and nectar. Concentrations of aluminum in fruit and pollen have been reported between 0.05 and 670mg/L in North America. This is particularly concerning for pollinators that ingest pollen and nectar. Honey bees represent a globally present species experiencing decline in Europe and North America. Region specific decline may be a result of differential toxicity of exposure between subspecies. We find that European honey bees (Apis mellifera mellifera) may have differential toxicity as compared to two allopatric Mediterranean subspecies (Apis mellifera carnica and Apis mellifera caucasica) which showed no within subspecies exposure differences. European honey bees were then used in a laboratory experiment and exposed to aluminum in their daily water supply to mimic nectar contamination at several concentrations. After approximately 3 weeks of aluminum ingestion these bees showed significantly shorter captive longevity than controls at concentrations as low as 10.4mg/L and showed a possible hormetic response in motility. We also compared European honey bees to Africanized/European hybrid bees (Apis mellifera mellifera/scutellata hybrid) in short-term free-flight experiments. Neither the European honey bee nor the hybrid showed immediate foraging deficits in flight time, color choice, or floral manipulation after aluminum exposure. We conclude that European honey bees are at the greatest risk of aluminum related decline from chronic ingestion as compared to other subspecies and offer new methods for future use in honey bee toxicology.},

	abstract = {To tackle pollinator declines, there is a major need to increase the quantity of flower-rich habitats. Road verges offer one such opportunity but are exposed to diverse forms of pollution from roads and road traffic. We carried out a broad initial assessment to establish if and how pollution affects the quality of road verges as pollinator foraging environments. We assessed the spatial distribution of pollution, flowers and pollinators in road verges, then used field experiments to simulate and measure the impacts of four ubiquitous and little studied forms of road pollution (noise, turbulence, dust and metals) on pollinator densities and foraging behaviour. We found that pollinators in road verges were exposed to noise, turbulence, dust and metal pollution, which decreased with distance from the road edge but, with the exception of turbulence, extended more than 8 m into road verges. Pollinator densities were lower closer to the road edge—particularly within first 2 m (55\% lower than at 7–9 m)—where pollution is greatest. This was despite a similar density and species richness of flowers. Simulated turbulence deterred pollinators by causing intermittent disturbance (reducing visit duration by up to 54\%), and some pollinator taxa preferentially avoided concentrations of metals that were more frequently found in flowers within 2 m of roads (resulting in up to 75\% fewer visits), while noise and dust had no apparent effect. Synthesis and applications. Pollinators in road verges are exposed to many forms of pollution, and we found impacts of roadside-realistic levels of turbulence and metals on pollinator densities and foraging behaviour. Although the findings suggest that road verges are largely suitable for pollinator conservation, management enhancements should prioritise areas more than 2 m from the road edge, and verges along roads with relatively lower traffic densities.},

At the same time, the industrial legacies of these urban ecosystems have resulted in elevated levels of heavy metals in surface soils, which could negatively affect bee populations. We investigated whether foraging within heavy metal contaminated landscapes represents a fitness cost for the common Eastern bumblebee Bombus impatiens, by placing colonies in residential backyards along an urban to rural gradient extending south and east from the city of Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Bees foraged in the landscape for 3 weeks, after which time we counted the total number of workers and larvae present in the colony and analysed castes for the presence of heavy metals. We then assessed the relationship between landscape composition, heavy metal loads and caste abundance. Colonies located in urban landscapes were more likely to be exposed to lead (Pb). Elevated concentrations of Pb within workers were negatively correlated with both the number of workers and the number of larvae present. Synthesis and applications. Our findings raise concern that lead (Pb) contamination could represent a significant challenge to bee conservation in cities. To elucidate risks posed by this pollutant, we highlight a need to quantify lethal and sub-lethal effects of Pb exposure using laboratory and field-based studies. Further, identifying routes of exposure and landscape factors that influence exposure risk is necessary to implement mitigation strategies as part of urban conservation initiatives.},

	abstract = {Heavy metal toxicity is an ecological concern in regions affected by processes like mining, industry, and agriculture. At sufficiently high concentrations, heavy metals are lethal to honey bees, but little is known about how sublethal doses affect honey bees or whether they will consume contaminated food. We investigated whether honey bees reject sucrose solutions contaminated with three heavy metals – cadmium, copper, and lead – as a measure of their ability to detect the metals, and whether ingesting these metals altered the bees’ sucrose sensitivity. The metals elicited three different response profiles in honey bees. Cadmium was not rejected in any of the assays, and ingesting cadmium did not alter sucrose sensitivity. Copper was rejected following antennal stimulation, but was readily consumed following proboscis stimulation. Ingestion of copper did not alter sucrose sensitivity. Lead appeared to be palatable at some concentrations and altered the bees’ sensitivity to and/or valuation of sucrose following antennal stimulation or ingestion of the metal. These differences likely represent unique mechanisms for detecting each metal and the pathology of toxicity. The bees’ ability to detect and consume these toxic metals highlights the risk of exposure to these elements for bees living in or near contaminated environments.},

	abstract = {Plants growing in heavy-metal-rich soils can accumulate metals into their nectar. Nectar chemical composition can alter foraging behavior of floral visitors (including pollinators and floral antagonists) and further affect plant reproductive fitness. The role of nectar heavy metals in deterring pollinators (e.g., shortening foraging time) has been recently studied, but their effects on plant reproduction via changes in behaviors of both pollinators and floral antagonists (e.g., nectar robbers) are less understood. We experimentally manipulated four nectar heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, and Pb) in a native ornamental plant, Hosta ensata F. Maekawa, to investigate the effect of nectar metals on plant reproductive success. We also recorded nectar robbing as well as foraging time and visitation rate of pollinators to assess whether nectar metals could alter the behavior of antagonists and mutualists. Although metals in nectar had no significant direct effects on plant reproduction via hand-pollination, we detected their positive indirect effects on components of female fitness mediated by pollinators and nectar robbers. Matching effects on female plant fitness, nectar robbers responded negatively to the presence of metals in nectar, robbing metal-treated flowers less often. Pollinators spent less time foraging on metal-treated flowers, but their visitation rate to metal-treated flowers was significantly higher than to control flowers. Moreover, pollinators removed less nectar from flowers treated with metals. Our results provide the first direct evidence to date that heavy metals in nectar are capable of deterring nectar robbers and modifying pollinator foraging behavior to enhance plant reproductive fitness. Heavy metals in nectar function as a defense against nectar robbing bumblebees, but they increased the visitation rate of pollinating bumblebees.},

In particular, the sublethal effects of lead contamination on bee foraging behavior could negatively impact plant-pollinator interactions and the sustainability of urban agriculture. It is difficult, however, to distinguish between differences in foraging behavior caused by lead contamination directly as compared to differences resulting from variation in floral traits, which can also be affected by contamination. We compared the foraging behavior of bees, specifically the number of visits and visit duration, at sunflowers grown in lead-contaminated and uncontaminated soils. We also measured soil lead contamination’s effects on sunflower morphological traits. While the number of visits a sunflower head received was not affected by soil lead contamination, bee visit duration was shorter at sunflowers grown in lead contaminated soil. This effect of lead contamination on visit duration was not mediated by sunflower floral traits, which were themselves affected by lead contamination. The inability of bees to distinguish between sunflowers grown in contaminated vs. uncontaminated soil prior to visitation suggests a possible bioaccumulation pathway for lead in bees.},

	abstract = {Manganese (Mn) is an essential trace element that acts as a metal co-factor in diverse biochemical and cellular functions. However, chronic environmental exposure to high levels of Mn is a well-established risk factor for the etiology of severe, atypical parkinsonian syndrome (manganism) via its accumulation in the basal ganglia, pallidum, and striatum brain regions, which is often associated with abnormal dopamine, GABA, and glutamate neural signaling. Recent studies have indicated that chronic Mn exposure at levels that are below the risk for manganism can still cause behavioral, cognitive, and motor dysfunctions via poorly understood mechanisms at the molecular and cellular levels. Furthermore, in spite of significant advances in understanding Mn-induced behavioral and neuronal pathologies, available data are primarily for human and rodents. In contrast, the possible impact of environmental Mn exposure on brain functions and behavior of other animal species, especially insects and other invertebrates, remains mostly unknown both in the laboratory and natural habitats. Yet, the effects of environmental exposure to metals such as Mn on insect development, physiology, and behavior could also have major indirect impacts on human health via the long-term disruptions of food webs, as well as direct impact on the economy because of the important role insects play in crop pollination. Indeed, laboratory and field studies indicate that chronic exposures to metals such as Mn, even at levels that are below what is currently considered toxic, affect the dopaminergic signaling pathway in the insect brain, and have a major impact on the behavior of insects, including foraging activity of important pollinators such as the honey bee. Together, these studies highlight the need for a better understanding of the neuronal, molecular, and genetic processes that underlie the toxicity of Mn and other metal pollutants in diverse animal species, including insects.},

	abstract = {We know very little about how soil-borne pollutants such as selenium (Se) can impact pollinators, even though Se has contaminated soils and plants in areas where insect pollination can be critical to the functioning of both agricultural and natural ecosystems. Se can be biotransferred throughout the food web, but few studies have examined its effects on the insects that feed on Se-accumulating plants, particularly pollinators. In laboratory bioassays, we used proboscis extension reflex (PER) and taste perception to determine if the presence of Se affected the gustatory response of honey bee (Apis mellifera L., Hymenoptera: Apidae) foragers. Antennae and proboscises were stimulated with both organic (selenomethionine) and inorganic (selenate) forms of Se that commonly occur in Se-accumulating plants. Methionine was also tested. Each compound was dissolved in 1 M sucrose at 5 concentrations, with sucrose alone as a control. Antennal stimulation with selenomethionine and methionine reduced PER at higher concentrations. Selenate did not reduce gustatory behaviors. Two hours after being fed the treatments, bees were tested for sucrose response threshold. Bees fed selenate responded less to sucrose stimulation. Mortality was higher in bees chronically dosed with selenate compared with a single dose. Selenomethionine did not increase mortality except at the highest concentration. Methionine did not significantly impact survival. Our study has shown that bees fed selenate were less responsive to sucrose, which may lead to a reduction in incoming floral resources needed to support coworkers and larvae in the field. If honey bees forage on nectar containing Se (particularly selenate), reductions in population numbers may occur due to direct toxicity. Given that honey bees are willing to consume food resources containing Se and may not avoid Se compounds in the plant tissues on which they are foraging, they may suffer similar adverse effects as seen in other insect guilds. © 2012 Hladun et al.

In areas of selenium (Se) contamination, honeybees may be at risk because of the biotransfer of Se from plant products such as nectar and pollen. Several forms of Se can occur in accumulating plants. In the present study, the toxicity of 4 compounds (selenate, selenite, methylselenocysteine, and selenocystine) to honeybee adult foragers and larvae was assessed using dose-response bioassays. Inorganic forms were more toxic than organic forms for both larvae (lethal concentration [LC50] selenate=0.72mgL-1, LC50 selenite=1.0mgL-1, LC50 methylselenocysteine=4.7mgL-1, LC50 selenocystine=4.4mgL-1) and foragers (LC50 selenate=58mgL-1, LC50 selenite=58mgL-1, LC50 methylselenocysteine=161mgL-1, LC50 selenocystine=148mgL-1). Inorganic forms of Se caused rapid mortality, and organic forms had sublethal effects on development. Larvae accumulated substantial amounts of Se only at the highest doses, whereas foragers accumulated large quantities at all doses. The present study documented very low larval LC50 values for Se; even modest transfer to brood will likely cause increased development times and mortality. The toxicities of the various forms of Se to honeybee larvae and foragers are discussed in comparison with other insect herbivores and detritivores. © 2013 SETAC.},

Highly reactive and often toxic at low concentrations, they may enter soils and groundwater, bioaccumulate in food webs, and adversely affect biota. Heavy metals also may remain in the environment for years, posing long-term risks to life well after point sources of heavy metal pollution have been removed. In this review, we compile studies of the community-level effects of heavy metal pollution, including heavy metal transfer from soils to plants, microbes, invertebrates, and to both small and large mammals (including humans). Many factors contribute to heavy metal accumulation in animals including behavior, physiology, and diet. Biotic effects of heavy metals are often quite different for essential and non-essential heavy metals, and vary depending on the specific metal involved. They also differ for adapted organisms, including metallophyte plants and heavy metal-tolerant insects, which occur in naturally high-metal habitats (such as serpentine soils) and have adaptations that allow them to tolerate exposure to relatively high concentrations of some heavy metals. Some metallophyte plants are hyperaccumulators of certain heavy metals and new technologies using them to clean metal-contaminated soil (phytoextraction) may offer economically attractive solutions to some metal pollution challenges. These new technologies provide incentive to catalog and protect the unique biodiversity of habitats that have naturally high levels of heavy metals.},

Furthermore, the number or quality of preclinical kidney-related studies has not been systematically evaluated. Methods We performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials published in 1966–2017 (listed in the Cochrane Library) and preclinical studies published in 1945–2017 (listed in PubMed). For reporting quality analysis, we evaluated the final main paper of 118 clinical trial reports and 135 preclinical studies published in leading journals in 1996, 2006, and 2016 on the basis of criteria from the widely used CONSORT and ARRIVE guidelines. Results The annual number of reports of clinical kidney-related trials more than doubled between 2004 and 2014 along with reports in other medical disciplines. Hypertension remains the dominant focus of study, but ongoing trials also center on CKD, ESRD, and AKI. The reporting quality analysis revealed improvements, but deficits in reporting of clinical trial design, mode of randomization, and intention-to-treat analysis remain. Annual numbers of kidney-related preclinical studies remained low between 1945 and 2017 compared with other disciplines. Reporting quality analysis of preclinical studies revealed substantial reporting deficits across all leading journals, with little improvement over the last 20 years, especially for group size calculations, defining primary versus secondary outcomes, and blinded analysis.

	abstract = {Australia has a long history of metal mining and smelting. Extraction and processing have resulted in elevated levels of toxic metals surrounding mining operations, which have adverse health effects, particularly to children. Resource companies, government agencies and employees often construct ‘myths’ to down play potential exposure risks and responsibility arising from operating emissions. Typical statements include: contaminants are naturally occurring, the wind blows emissions away from residential areas, contaminants are not bioavailable, or the problem is a legacy issue and not related to current operations. Evidence from mining and smelting towns shows that such ‘myths’ are exactly that. In mining towns, the default and primary defence against contamination is that elevated metals in adjacent urban environments are from the erosion and weathering of the ore bodies over millennia—hence ‘naturally occurring’. Not only is this a difficult argument to unravel from an evidence-based perspective, but also it causes confusion and delays remediation work, hindering efforts to reduce harmful exposures to children. An example of this situation is from Broken Hill, New South Wales, home to one of the world’s largest lead–zinc–silver ore body, which has been mined continuously for over 130 years. Environmental metal concentration and lead isotopic data from soil samples collected from across Broken Hill are used to establish the nature and timing of lead contamination. We use multiple lines of evidence to unravel a ‘miner’s myth’ by evaluating current soil metal concentrations and lead isotopic compositions, geological data, historical environmental assessments and old photographic evidence to assess the impacts from early smelting along with mining to the surface soils in the city.},

The consequences of Australia's protracted industrial lead emissions and subsequent depositions caused widespread contamination of urban and peri-urban aerosols, soils, plants, animals, and humans. This paper charts the impact of those lead emissions via environmental archives and proxies and examines the extent of recovery from one of the biosphere's most pervasive and persistent environmental pollutants. The remobilisation of industrial lead is examined by analysis of Sydney air filters that bracket wildfires between 1994 and 2004. Proxy atmospheric measurements of historical wine, lichen and fungi samples extending up to 150 years bp show how both lead concentration and isotopic composition values shifted in the middle to late 20th century to reflect petrol emissions and then recovered rapidly at the end of the century as leaded petrol was phased out. Lead isotopic composition of aerosol filters from Adelaide and Sydney show that air lead composition shifted from values that approximate Broken Hill type ores, the predominant lead source used in petrol (206Pb/207Pb = 1.04; 208Pb/207Pb = 2.32), towards ratios that more closely match local uncontaminated soil and bedrock values in Adelaide (206Pb/207Pb = 1.21; 208Pb/207Pb = 2.52) and Sydney (206Pb/207Pb = 1.14; 208Pb/207Pb = 2.44). However, the recovery from that historic industrial lead contamination is incomplete. Measurements of contemporary surface soils, ash produced from wildfires and aerosols demonstrate legacy industrial lead depositions are declining but are still subject to remobilisation.},

	abstract = {Lead concentrations and lead isotopic compositions were determined in historic central and southern Victoria, Australia lichen (Cladonia and Usnea) and fungi (Trametes) samples collected between 1852 and 2008 to evaluate long-term atmospheric lead contamination sources. The data are grouped into four time intervals of 1850-1931, 1932-1984, 1985-2001 and 2002-2008 corresponding to the history of leaded petrol use in Australia. Elevated lichen and fungi lead concentrations and relatively high isotopic compositions from the period 1850-1931 are attributed to lithogenic sources, gold mining activities and early industrialisation. Significant increases in lichen and fungi lead concentrations and concomitant lower lead isotopic compositions correspond to the marked increase in lead emissions from leaded petrol use after 1932. Following the end of leaded petrol use in 2002 lead isotopic composition values 'recover' toward more lithogenic values. However, the lead isotopic composition data indicate that the environmental impact from leaded petrol emissions persists in contemporary samples dated to 2002-2008. Overall, the data reveal that herbarium lichens and fungi from central and southern Victoria can be used as proxies for environmental lead emissions over the past 150 years.},

To overcome these historical constraints and to make ecology inclusive of the diverse peoples inhabiting Earth’s varied ecosystems, ecologists must expand their knowledge, both in theory and practice, to incorporate varied perspectives, approaches and interpretations from, with and within the natural environment and across global systems. We outline five shifts that could help to transform academic ecological practice: decolonize your mind; know your histories; decolonize access; decolonize expertise; and practise ethical ecology in inclusive teams. We challenge the discipline to become more inclusive, creative and ethical at a moment when the perils of entrenched thinking have never been clearer.},

	abstract = {Naturally-occurring deuterium stable isotope ratios can potentially be used to trace water resource use by animals, but estimating the contribution of isotopically distinct water sources requires the accurate prediction of isotopic discrimination factors between water inputs and an animal's body water pool. We examined the feasibility of using estimates of water fluxes between a bird and its environment with a mass-balance model for the deuterium stable isotope ratio of avian body water (δDbody) to predict isotopic discrimination factors. Apparent fractionation and thus discrimination factors were predicted to vary with the proportion of an animal's total water losses than could be attributed to evaporative processes. To test our ability to predict isotopic discrimination, we manipulated water intake and evaporative water loss in rock doves (Columba livia) by providing them with fresh water or 0.15 M NaCl solution in thermoneutral or hot environments. After we switched the birds from drinking water with δD=-95‰ VSMOW (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water) to enriched drinking water with δD=+52‰ VSMOW, steady-state δDbody was approached asymptotically. The equilibrium δDbody was enriched by 10-50‰ relative to water inputs. After isotopic equilibrium was reached, the degree of enrichment was positively related (r2=0.34) to the fraction of total water loss that occurred by evaporation (reVap/rH2O) supporting the major prediction of the model. The variation we observed in discrimination factors suggests that the apparent fractionation of deuterium will be difficult to predict accurately under natural conditions. Our results show that accurate estimates of the contribution of different water sources to a bird's body water pool require large deuterium isotopic differences between the sources. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Milkweed from multiple population sources collected across a latitudinal gradient in Wisconsin, USA, were grown under all combinations of ambient or elevated temperature and the presence or absence of periodic water stress. Elevated temperature marginally increased, while water stress decreased plant growth. Milkweed from more northerly latitudes experienced larger growth responses to elevated temperature and were more resistant to water stress, especially under higher temperatures. Elevated temperature and water stress also altered milkweed composite foliar trait profiles. Elevated temperature generally increased leaf nitrogen and structural compounds, and decreased leaf mass per area. Water stress also elevated foliar nitrogen, but reduced defensive traits. Monarch larvae performed well on milkweed under elevated temperature and water stress, but gained the most mass on plants exposed to both treatments in combination. Our findings suggest that milkweed populations from more northerly latitudes in the upper Midwest may benefit more from rising temperatures than those in southerly locations, but that these beneficial effects depend on water availability. Monarch larvae grew larger on plants from all experimental treatments relative to ambient condition controls, indicating that future changes in milkweed presence on the landscape will likely influence monarch populations more than the effects of future changes in plant quality on larval performance.},

	abstract = {Background: The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) is a conspicuous insect that has experienced a drastic population decline over the past two decades. While there are several factors contributing to dwindling monarch populations, habitat loss is considered the most significant threat to monarchs. In the United States, loss of milkweed, particularly in the Midwest, has greatly reduced the available breeding habitat of monarchs. This has led to extensive efforts to conserve and restore milkweed resources throughout the Midwest. Recently, these research and conservation efforts have been expanded to include other important areas along the monarch's migratory path. Results: During the fall of 2018, we conducted surveys of monarch eggs and larvae through West Texas. We documented monarch and queen butterfly (Danaus gilippus) reproduction throughout the region and used the proportion of monarch and queen larva to estimate the number of monarch eggs. Peak egg densities for monarchs were as high as 0.78 per milkweed ramet after correction for the presence of queens. Despite our observations encompassing only a limited sample across one season, the peak monarch egg densities we observed exceeded published reports from when monarch populations were higher. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to correct for the presence of queens when calculating the density of monarch eggs. This research also provides insight into monarch utilization of less well-known regions, such as West Texas, and highlights the need to expand the scope of monarch monitoring and conservation initiatives. While the importance of monarch research and conservation in the Midwest is unquestionable, more comprehensive efforts may identify new priorities in monarch conservation and lead to a more robust and effective overall strategy, particularly given the dynamic and rapidly changing global environment.},

	abstract = {1. As ectotherms, insects often experience varying temperatures throughout their life cycle, and some respond by becoming more or less melanistic (dark coloring) during development to increase or decrease thermal energy absorption as larvae or adults. 2. Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) breed in temperate and tropical environments worldwide and are exposed to different average and extreme temperatures in different parts of their geographic range. In this study, we compared variation in thermally induced melanism among monarch butterflies from eastern and western North America and from South Florida. 3. We raised the progeny of wild-captured adult butterflies from these populations in a common garden experiment, rearing individuals in cold (19°C), moderate (26°C), and hot (32°C) temperatures to examine population variation in larval and adult pigmentation. 4. Across all populations, monarch larvae developed the darkest coloration in the cold treatment and were lightest when reared in hot temperatures. Similar results were observed for measures of adult wing melanism, with the exception of adult females, which developed darker colored wings in warmer temperatures. 5. Significant population-level differences in average measures of melanism among larvae and adult butterflies were observed. Larvae from the eastern population became substantially darker in colder temperatures than S. Florida or western larvae. Western larvae were lightest overall, which might be adaptive to high temperatures experienced throughout portions of their summer breeding range. S. Florida larvae showed a lower response to cold temperatures relative to monarchs from either migratory population. 6. Population level differences were also observed for thermal responses in wing melanism, particularly among adult females. Moreover, we found significant family level effects for each measure of larval and adult melanism, pointing to a genetic basis or strong maternal effects influencing these traits in monarch butterflies. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we introduce MixSIAR, an inclusive, rich, and flexible Bayesian tracer (e.g., stable isotope) mixing model framework implemented as an open-source R package. Using MixSIAR as a foundation, we provide guidance for the implementation of mixing model analyses. We begin by outlining the practical differences between mixture data error structure formulations and relate these error structures to common mixing model study designs in ecology. Because Bayesian mixing models afford the option to specify informative priors on source proportion contributions, we outline methods for establishing prior distributions and discuss the influence of prior specification on model outputs. We also discuss the options available for source data inputs (raw data versus summary statistics) and provide guidance for combining sources. We then describe a key advantage of MixSIAR over previous mixing model software-the ability to include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions and calculate relative support for multiple models via information criteria. We present a case study of Alligator mississippiensis diet partitioning to demonstrate the power of this approach. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of limitations to mixing model applications. Through MixSIAR, we have consolidated the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform, diversified the set of available parameterizations, and provided developers a platform upon which to continue improving mixing model analyses in the future.},

We generated knock-in alleles of murine Lgr6,a closerelative Downloaded from http://science.sciencemag.org/ on September 20, 2018 of the Lgr5 stem cell gene. Lgr6 was expressed in the earliest embryonic hair placodes. In adult hair follicles, Lgr6+ cells resided in a previously uncharacterized region directly above the follicle bulge. They expressed none of the known bulge stem cell markers. Prenatal Lgr6+ cells established the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular epidermis. Postnatally, Lgr6+ cells generated sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis, whereas contribution to hair lineages gradually diminished with age. Adult Lgr6+ cells executed long-term wound repair, including the formation of new hair follicles. We conclude that Lgr6 marks the most primitive epidermal stem cell. I},

	abstract = {Explaining parasite virulence is a great challenge for evolutionary biology. Intuitively, parasites that depend on their hosts for their survival should be benign to their hosts, yet many parasites cause harm. One explanation for this is that within-host competition favors virulence, with more virulent strains having a competitive advantage in genetically diverse infections. This idea, which is well supported in theory, remains untested empirically. Here we provide evidence that within-host competition does indeed select for high parasite virulence. We examine the rodent malaria Plasmodium chabaudi in laboratory mice, a parasite-host system in which virulence can be easily monitored and competing strains quantified by using strain-specific real-time PCR. As predicted, we found a strong relationship between parasite virulence and competitive ability, so that more virulent strains have a competitive advantage in mixed-strain infections. In transmission experiments, we found that the strain composition of the parasite populations in mosquitoes was directly correlated with the composition of the blood-stage parasite population. Thus, the outcome of within-host competition determined relative transmission success. Our results imply that within-host competition is a major factor driving the evolution of virulence and can explain why many parasites harm their hosts. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

Our modeling reveals patterns of movement across a geographically extensive range during the animal's {\textasciitilde}28-year life span that varied with life stages.

	abstract = {The expansion of the wind energy industry has had benefits in terms of increased renewable energy production but has also led to increased mortality of migratory bats due to interactions with wind turbines. A key question that could guide bat-related management activities is identifying the geographic origin of bats killed at wind-energy facilities. Generating this information requires developing new methods for identifying the geographic sources of individual bats. Here we explore the viability of assigning geographic origin using trace element analyses of fur to infer the summer molting location of eastern red bats (Lasiurus borealis). Our approach is based on the idea that the concentration of trace elements in bat fur is related through the food chain to the amount of trace elements present in the soil, which varies across large geographic scales. Specifically, we used inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry to determine the concentration of fourteen trace elements in fur of 126 known-origin eastern red bats to generate a basemap for assignment throughout the range of this species in eastern North America. We then compared this map to publicly available soil trace element concentrations for the U.S. and Canada, used a probabilistic framework to generate likelihood-of-origin maps for each bat, and assessed how well trace element profiles predicted the origins of these individuals. Overall, our results suggest that trace elements allow successful assignment of individual bats 80\% of the time while reducing probable locations in half. Our study supports the use of trace elements to identify the geographic origin of eastern red and perhaps other migratory bats, particularly when combined with data from other biomarkers such as genetic and stable isotope data.},

	abstract = {A synthesis of published vegetation mercury (Hg) data across 11 contiguous states in the western United States showed that aboveground biomass concentrations followed the order: leaves (26 μg kg− 1) {\textasciitilde} branches (26 μg kg− 1) {\textgreater} bark (16 μg kg− 1) {\textgreater} bole wood (1 μg kg− 1). No spatial trends of Hg in aboveground biomass distribution were detected, which likely is due to very sparse data coverage and different sampling protocols. Vegetation data are largely lacking for important functional vegetation types such as shrubs, herbaceous species, and grasses. Soil concentrations collected from the published literature were high in the western United States, with 12\% of observations exceeding 100 μg kg− 1, reflecting a bias toward investigations in Hg-enriched sites. In contrast, soil Hg concentrations from a randomly distributed data set (1911 sampling points; Smith et al., 2013a) averaged 24 μg kg− 1 (A-horizon) and 22 μg kg− 1 (C-horizon), and only 2.6\% of data exceeded 100 μg kg− 1. Soil Hg concentrations significantly differed among land covers, following the order: forested upland {\textgreater} planted/cultivated {\textgreater} herbaceous upland/shrubland {\textgreater} barren soils. Concentrations in forests were on average 2.5 times higher than in barren locations. Principal component analyses showed that soil Hg concentrations were not or weakly related to modeled dry and wet Hg deposition and proximity to mining, geothermal areas, and coal-fired power plants. Soil Hg distribution also was not closely related to other trace metals, but strongly associated with organic carbon, precipitation, canopy greenness, and foliar Hg pools of overlying vegetation. These patterns indicate that soil Hg concentrations are related to atmospheric deposition and reflect an overwhelming influence of plant productivity — driven by water availability — with productive landscapes showing high soil Hg accumulation and unproductive barren soils and shrublands showing low soil Hg values. Large expanses of low-productivity, arid ecosystems across the western U.S. result in some of the lowest soil Hg concentrations observed worldwide.},

	abstract = {Wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was used to make quantitative determinations of the elemental composition of adults of Agrotis segetum (Denis \& Schiffermüller) that had been reared on one of eight soil-plant combinations or a semi-synthetic diet. Robust-means principal components analysis (RMPCA) of the data for eight elements and all treatments (except for the semi-synthetic diet) separated the means of the groups by soil type, irrespective of host-plant. However, individuals could not be separated until the data were grouped into the two host-plant sub-sets. The main discriminant, Al, was of doubtful validity and was therefore excluded from the data which were reanalysed by RMPCA. This failed to discriminate either group means or individuals until each host-plant sub-set was analysed separately; then, individuals could be differentiated by soil type although not as distinctly as when Al was included in the data. There was, however, a clear separation of the sexes because of a higher content of K and lower content of Ca in females; these two elements, together with S and Cl, were the main discriminants of soil type. It is concluded that larval host-plant is a significant factor in the elemental composition of adults of A. segetum but limiting and confounding in respect of identification of soil type and, therefore, geographical source. This conclusion probably applies also to other similar polyphagous species, but specific differences in biology and behaviour may influence the applicability of the technique to field studies. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

We explored multi-elemental profiles of an insect pest and its food from different locations in order to identify intrinsic markers of geographic origin. ICP-AES screening was completed for soil, maize grains and Prostephanus truncatus of different geographic origin, with insects collected in the field or reared on maize under controlled conditions. Background level geochemical data are presented with concentrations of Cu, S and Sr in maize, and Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, S, Si, Sr, Ti and Zn in insects differing according to their origin, or that of their food. Cu, Fe and Zn determinations of insects were 20, 6.5 and 11.5 times the concentrations of the maize they were reared on. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on Al, Fe, Sr and Zn successfully assigned 78\% of laboratory-reared P. truncatus and 94\% of field-caught insects to their origin (68\% and 75\% respectively after jacknifing). There was excellent discrimination between insects reared on maize from Guanajuato and Nuevo Léon, and Guanajuato and Michoacán, good separation between Sonora and Nuevo Léon but overlap for Sonora, Guanajuato and Michoacán, and Michoacán and Nuevo Léon. The same LDA for field-caught insects gave complete separation between Michoacán and Sonora, but some overlap between Michoacán and Nuevo Léon. This robust ICP-AES technique successfully identified a combination of elements able to classify insects according to their origin. The model was restricted to elements showing a normal distribution but nonparametric tests suggest other elements may act as intrinsic markers. This shows the potential of atomic spectroscopy for remotely tracing insects and other biological materials, with applications including providing provenance data for species routinely captured for surveillance and to track natural enemies and wildlife.},

The isotopic compositions of various body tissues have been demonstrated to be useful biomarkers for tracking locations and movements to aid in the identification of human remains. This study closes the large spatial gap of available 87Sr/86Sr ratios from North America in tap water and presents the first 87Sr/86Sr human tissue-based ratios from Mexico. The 101 hair samples from 32 locations in Mexico range in 87Sr/86Sr ratios from 0.70424 to 0.71613 (ΔSrmax–min = 0.01189). Furthermore, 151 tap water samples from 51 locations range between 0.70404 to 0.71385 (ΔSrmax–min = 0.00981). Overall, small variations in the hair and tap water samples collected from individual locations were recorded (ΔSrmax–min = 0.00041 and 0.00034 respectively). Despite the fact that Mexico is one of the largest bottled water consumers in the world, the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of human hair and tap water correlated strongly (R2 = 0.87 for location averages and R2 = 0.80 when using individual data points). These data represent a valuable resource for identifying the provenance of human remains.},

However, despite this, studies examining the urban water system remain limited. This study sought to address this knowledge gap by performing a 24 h multiparameter analysis of tap water extracted from a region where the mixing of groundwater between two recharge areas occurs. This work included measurements of temperature and electrical conductivity, as well as pH, δ2H, δ18O, d, δ13CDIC, and 87 Sr/86Sr ratios and major and trace elements at hourly intervals over a 24 h period. Although the data show only slight variations in the measured parameters, four groups were distinguishable using visual grouping, and multivariate analysis (Spearman correlation coefficient analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, and principal components analysis). Finally, changes in the mixing ratios of the two sources were estimated using a linear mixing model. The results confirm that the relative contribution from each source varied considerably over 24 h.},

These techniques are; (i) a centrifugation technique using diiodomethane where hair and soil particles are separated by density difference; (ii) a leaching technique of the hair surface using 2 M HNO 3 acid and (iii) cleaning the hair with chloroform, methanol and ultra pure water. These techniques are validated and are successfully applied to demonstrate the capability of modern and archaeological human scalp hair and modern human facial hair to record Sr and Pb isotope variations related to geographic location. In this study, Sr isotope ratios analysed in modern human scalp hair from a female vegetarian and non-smoker register marked isotopic change on a monthly timescale when an individual moves to locations with contrasting Sr isotope compositions. Pb isotope ratios do not show significant changes after moving locations, possibly due to comparable Pb isotope ratios in the two environments. In contrast, Pb isotopes ratios analysed in facial hair from a male omnivore and smoker record isotopic changes within a two week period when moving between locations with significant differences in environmental Pb isotope compositions. Further research is needed to determine the exact rate of change in isotopic composition in scalp and facial hair in humans with different diets and life styles that move from geographical locations with isotopic contrasting composition. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

We use multi-isotope hair profiles to investigate Madame Victoria's travel and diet history. Based on carbon isotope abundances, Madame Victoria had a stable diet and values typical of eastern Canada. Nitrogen isotope ratios are more positive than average Canadians, and increase sharply over the last two months of her life, likely reflecting a rapid health deterioration. Hydrogen isotope abundances are typical of eastern Canada, and become stepwise more positive throughout the hair profile. Based on hydrogen isotope data, Madame Victoria moved progressively from either a western Ontario or northern Quebec locality towards Montreal over the last 3 years of her life stopping multiple times along the way. The strontium isotope ratios are constant throughout the hair profile and equal to the isotopic value of the soil exchangeable strontium at the site where the body was discovered. This observation, combined with hair major and trace elemental data, indicates that strontium from soil diffused and replaced the original hair strontium post-mortem. This study shows the interest of multi-isotope hair profiles to focus investigations on cold cases but also underlines the need for further work to take advantage of metal and metal isotope data.},

In this study, we analyzed both the elemental concentration and isotope ratios of Sr and Pb from four different women of different ages to monitor their permanent relocation from central France to Eastern Canada during the summer 2012. For comparison, we also characterized bulk hair samples of sedentary individuals and local tap waters from their regions of origin and of settlement. Our results indicate that the $^{\textrm{87}}$Sr/$^{\textrm{86}}$Sr and $^{\textrm{206}}$Pb/$^{\textrm{204}}$Pb ratios are significantly modified by the change of environment, but also confirm that human hair compositions are impacted by other external factors (such as dust).

	abstract = {The elements of human hair record specific information about an individual's health, diet, and surrounding environment. Strontium isotope ratios of human hair have attracted interest as they potentially record an individual's environment. Yet, separating the external environmental signals from the internal dietary indicators has remained a challenge. Here, we examined the effects of five different hair-cleaning methodologies to determine the extent that internal and external strontium signals can be isolated from human hair. In the first study of its kind, we employed an in-line strontium purification methodology and a multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer to obtain high-precision strontium isotope ratio of human hair and of leachates of the different washing treatments. We found that the different applications of an individual treatment removed a consistent amount of strontium from hair and that replicate analyses showed each treatment altered the strontium isotope ratios of hair consistently. A mass-balance approach was applied to demonstrate that strontium was quantitatively removed and was accounted for in either the treated hair or the leachate. We observed that strontium isotope ratio varied as a function of treatment aggressiveness so as to suggest that there was a fine-scale structuring of strontium within hair (transverse cross-sectional variations); these variations existed as differences in strontium concentrations and isotope ratios. As a result, the Sr isotope ratio of hair and hair leachates treated with the most aggressive cleaning methods reflected the isotope ratios of the interior and total exterior strontium signatures, respectively. The results of this study indicate that external environmental strontium signals can be distinguished from the internal signals and therefore permit the application of strontium isotope ratios of modern human hair for geospatial applications. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) has been widely used to trace human migrations across geologically distinct landscapes in archaeological and forensic sciences. 87Sr/86Sr-based provenance studies require a detailed strontium reference map to make valid interpretations of mobility patterns for a given region. In this study, we first review the previous development for 87Sr/86Sr isoscapes relevant to research on migration and then present the first map of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for China, based on 1935 measurements on biosphere samples collated from published research and supplemented by our targeted collection strategy. The results show that 87Sr/86Sr ratios in China span a large range and exhibit regional patterns largely dependent on the divergent geological conditions of each of China's tectonic blocks. We further combine river water 87Sr/86Sr ratios with lithology, integrated elemental data, and chemical weathering rates, to determine which dominant weathering patterns (e.g. silicate, carbonate or evaporite) have the most significant influence on 87Sr/86Sr ratios. The low ranges of 87Sr/86Sr ratios ({\textless} 0.711) are predominately present in the Xing'an-Mongolian orogenic belt, which is composed of mafic-ultramafic silicate rocks, as well as in the Yangtze Block and the Junggar terrane-Tian Shan-northern Tarim Block, which are both influenced by the weathering of carbonate rocks. The intermediate ranges of Sr isotopes (0.711–0.7125) are mainly found in the North China Block, the northern Tibetan Plateau, and the southern Tarim Block, which may be because of evaporite dissolution and silicate/carbonate weathering processes. The high ranges of Sr isotope ratios ({\textgreater} 0.7125) appear in the Cathaysia Block as well as some orogenic belts and the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, likely due to the influence of the metamorphic rocks and granitoid sources. Additionally, topography, differential weathering among lithologies, and eolian deposits (e.g. loess) are also significant factors that influence 87Sr/86Sr ratios in China. Our study reveals that the large variation of 87Sr/86Sr ratios across China is predominately driven by geological conditions, revealing that future Sr isotope provenance studies can shed on ancient and historical migrations in China.},

	abstract = {Sr isotopes are a powerful tool used for provenancing in many disciplines, but their successful application requires the availability of robust Sr baselines of potential target areas. This study presents 87Sr/86Sr signatures and Sr concentrations of water, plants and soil leachates from the Peloponnese peninsula, Greece, to establish the first comprehensive bioavailable Sr isotope baseline for this region. Additionally, this study aims to evaluate which proxy is most suitable to characterise bioavailable Sr in a geologically complex area also exposed to foreign aeolian Sr sources. Our recorded bioavailable Sr isotope signatures correspond well with the surface lithologies characteristic of the Peloponnese. Unradiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios and a narrow isotope range (0.70779–0.70955) characterise the bioavailable Sr signatures of the sedimentary deposits and more radiogenic and isotopically variable values (0.70791–0.72370) were measured for metamorphic and igneous rock outcrops. The differences in 87Sr/86Sr values measured between proxies of one site are comparatively low for samples from the sedimentary and igneous deposits, while the overall spread in 87Sr/86Sr values is wider for samples from metamorphic deposits. We propose to define bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr baseline ranges as the average bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratio of all proxies of each lithology ± its double standard deviation (x̅ ± 2σ). This results in narrow baselines for the sedimentary outcrops of 0.70832 ± 0.00053 (n = 58) for clastic sediments and 0.70835 ± 0.00089 (n = 29) for chemical sediments. The metamorphic deposits are characterised by wider bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr baselines of 0.70906 ± 0.00116 (n = 4) and 0.71429 ± 0.01133 (n = 13) for marble and schist, respectively. The bioavailable Sr baseline for igneous rock outcrops is also characterised by a comparatively wide range with 0.70950 ± 0.00259 (n = 7). The wide range in inter- and intra-site specific bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr variation observed in this study emphasise the need for comprehensive multi-proxy sampling strategies within geologically-complex areas.},

However, systematic studies of law enforcement packaging materials and evidence packaging protocols are needed, including the full range of sample types and conditions anticipated in casework. Arm 1 of this study examined the impact of freezing storage on hair samples using the FBI's recommended storage materials (paper, plastic) and Mesa Police Department's evidence packaging guidelines for varying periods of freezing storage (three weeks, five months). Hair studied was from individuals of different ancestry, including cosmetic treatments (relaxer, dyes), and exposure to decomposition fluids outdoors for up to 10 months. Arm 2 evaluated longer-term storage, comparing hair stored in a desiccator to hair frozen at −20 °C for up to four years. Samples and certified standards were anonymized and randomized during sample preparation. To prevent cognitive bias from influencing interpretations, unblinding of samples only occurred after data correction and reduction were complete. Both the experimental and longer-term storage studies demonstrated δ13C, δ15N, and δ18O values had no significant offsets between frozen samples and those stored at room temperature. However, there were small systematic offsets (+2 to +3‰) in δ2H values, with frozen samples being enriched in 2H compared to controls. In a minority of samples frozen for {\textgreater}six months, δ2H offsets of {\textgreater}9‰ were observed, an amount that could impact the interpretation of an individual's geographic travel history.},

To test this hypothesis, we compared the O-Sr isotope profiles of hair from domestic horses with known residency histories.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMethods{\textbackslash}nTail hairs were collected from a pair of horses pastured together for a period of 16 months, one of which lived in a different location for the 8 months prior. Hair samples were washed with solvents to remove external contaminants prior to sequential sampling for δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr analysis via TC/EA-IRMS and MC-ICP-MS, respectively. Hair digests were concentrated and analyzed employing low-flow natural aspiration to measure 87Sr/86Sr.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nResults{\textbackslash}nTail hair from the control and transported horses had mean δ18O values of 11.25 ± 1.62 ‰ and 10.96 ± 1.53 ‰, and mean 87Sr/86Sr of 0.7101 ± 0.0006 and 0.7109 ± 0.0020, respectively. The δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr profiles for the control and transported horses were indistinguishable when they were pastured together. The 87Sr/86Sr profiles were significantly different during the period that the horses were living apart, while the δ18O values were indistinguishable during that period.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nConclusions{\textbackslash}nBy comparing the O-Sr isotope profiles of a control and transported horse, we investigated isotopic signal(s) potentially useful for reconstructing travel histories via high-resolution sequential sampling along single strands of tail hair. Improved analytical capabilities allowed for extremely low Sr abundance samples to be analyzed for 87Sr/86Sr and proved capable of resolving a horse's movement between distinct regions.

This dataset is supplemented by 87Sr/86Sr ratios predicted for several carbonate rock units. High, radiogenic Sr isotope ratios ({\textgreater}0.72), related to the Pleistocene glacial deposits, are omnipresent throughout the country and are also found in the Sudetes and the Holy Cross Mountains, where igneous and clastic Palaeozoic rocks are widely exposed. The lowest Sr signatures ({\textless}0.71) occur predominantly in the Silesian-Małopolska and Lublin uplands and are related to exposures of Palaeozoic, Mesozoic, and Neogene carbonate rocks. The large variation of 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the environment across the country is chiefly driven by the diversity in the geological substrate, and locally, it is also influenced by anthropogenic contamination. Strontium isoscapes for the geological substrate and surface waters differ from each other, in terms of the range of 87Sr/86Sr values and their distributional pattern. The differences result primarily from mixing processes in the geosphere (weathering), hydrosphere, and biosphere that control Sr inputs from various natural sources present in the environment. On the other side, they are also created by anthropogenic contamination of surface water and presumably of soils. This situation has important implications for future archaeological provenance and migration studies, as isoscapes for surface water and vegetation cannot be directly used to estimate the local 87Sr/86Sr baselines for past human populations. Therefore, caution is required when modern Sr data of surface water and plants are used in archaeological research. 87Sr/86Sr values of the geological substrate, which may be affected by anthropogenic contamination to a lesser extent than water, soil, and vegetation, are favoured for the baseline estimation for historical times.},

Human scalp hair samples from four body donations were collected at different stages throughout gross body decomposition. The willed-donated bodies were placed to decompose outdoors at the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility (FARF) at Texas State University. Hair fibres from two of the donations were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution light microscopy (HRLM). Chemical and microbiological degradation of hair fibres occurred rapidly after placement of the body outdoors. Measurements of scalp hair isotopic composition demonstrated that H-Pb-Sr isotope ratios were altered within days after environmental exposure, presumably by deposition, leaching and/or exchange with the local bioavailable soil, and vapour. The degree of physical hair degradation and changes in H-Pb-Sr isotope composition were not correlated. We conclude that antemortem isotopic H-Pb-Sr isotope ratios are difficult to recover in hairs derived from decomposing whole bodies.},

It also describes a few of the isotopic tools and data resources currently available to forensic investigators. Human tissues can be categorized into tissues with a longer-term memory such as bone and teeth and tissues with a shorter-term memory such as hair and nail. Isotopic profiling of human hair has received a good deal of attention in the past decade, and a rich repository of published knowledge exists on the particular challenge that is H isotope abundance analysis of hair. The isotopic profiles of human tissues such as bone, teeth, hair and nail hold great potential for forensic investigations by providing valuable information regarding an unidentified decedent's life history that cannot be obtained by any other analytical method.},

	abstract = {The use of bioavailable strontium in different environments to provenance biological materials has become increasingly common since its first applications in ecology and archaeology almost four decades ago. Provenancing biological materials using strontium isotope ratios requires a map of bioavailable strontium, commonly known as an isoscape, to compare results with. Both producing the isoscape and using it to interpret results present methodological challenges that researchers must carefully consider. A review of current research indicates that, while many archives can be analyzed to produce isoscapes, modern plant materials usually provide the best approximation of bioavailable strontium and can be used alone or combined with other archives if applying machine learning. Domain mapping currently produces the most accurate, most interpretable isoscapes for most research questions; however, machine learning approaches promise to provide more accurate and geographically wide-ranging isoscapes over time. Using strontium isotope analysis for provenancing is most successful when combined with other isotopes and/or trace elements as part of a likelihood approach. Strontium isoscapes that are both appropriate and sufficiently high resolution to answer specific research questions do not exist for most parts of the world. Researchers intending to incorporate strontium analysis into their research designs should expect to conduct primary sampling and analysis to create appropriate isoscapes or refine existing ones, which should themselves not be uncritically utilized. When sampling, it is essential to collect appropriate metadata; these metadata and the results of the analyses should be archived in one of several online databases to maximize their usefulness. With increasing amounts of primary data and the likely increased availability of machine learning approaches to mapping, strontium analysis will continue to improve as a method of provenancing.},

This study combined mineral element analysis and multivariate statistical analysis to discriminate the origins of 148 blueberry samples from three regions of China. The concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Cu, Mn, B, P, and Zn were determined inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Variance analysis (ANOVA), Duncan’s multiple-comparison test, and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to compare the element concentrations, and statistically significant differences were found among samples from different regions. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP-NN), and support vector machine (SVM) were utilized to build models for blueberry authentication. The results showed that the average concentrations of the minerals were in the order of K {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} Ca {\textgreater} Mg {\textgreater} Na {\textgreater} Mn {\textgreater} Fe {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} B {\textgreater} Cu, and the levels of K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Mn, B, P, and Zn were significantly different among regions by ANOVA and Duncan’s multiple-comparison test. The study indicates that LDA, DT, MLP-NN, and SVM chemometric tools have the potential to discriminate the origin of blueberries. The results revealed that the MLP-NN and SVM models were more discriminative than the other two mathematical methods. The MLP-NN yielded an average discrimination rate of 92.7\% for the training set and 94.7\% for the test set, and the SVM with linear kernel function (SVM-lin) obtained an average identification rate of 91.8\% for the training set and 94.7\% for the test set. The order of successful identification rates was as follows: MLP-NN {\textgreater} SVM-lin {\textgreater} DT {\textgreater} LDA. This study can serve as a reference to identify the origin of blueberries and perform quality assurance for the fruit.},

	abstract = {This article reviews the solids NMR research conducted on insect sclerotized structures in the last 10 years and previews some of the experiments that will be conducted in the future. Solids NMR has been used as a noninvasive approach to investigate the chemical compositions of, and some covalent interactions that occur in, several types of sclerotized structures that are otherwise highly intractable to conventional chemical analyses. Sclerotization is a complex process used by insects to confer stability and mechanical versatility to their cuticular exoskeletons and certain other proteinaceous structures. Samples analyzed include cuticular exoskeletons, egg cases, egg shells, cocoons and peritrophic membranes. Cross polarization, dipolar decoupling, magic angle spinning, magnetization dephasing, and isotropic enrichment were used to obtain high resolution spectra that provide information about the types and relative concentrations of carbon atoms as well as internuclear distances and covalent bonds between carbon and nitrogen atoms. Relative amounts of protein, chitin, catechols, lipids, pigment, and oxalate were estimated. Covalent interactions between protein nitrogens and catechol carbons were detected in the stiff brown pupal cuticle of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. The results of these solids NMR studies support the hypothesis that sclerotization of insect structures occurs primarily when quinones derived from N-acylcatecholamines form cross-links and adducts with functional groups of proteins deposited in the structures. Future applications of solids NMR will utilize advanced techniques for further probing the covalent interactions of 13C, 15N and 17O-labeled catechols, chitin and protein in sclerotized structures. © 1995.},

Analyses were done for seven elements: Fe, Zn, Cu, Pb, AI, Mg, and K. The quantities of K and Mg present were positively related to the dry weight of individual flies, while the others showed an exponential decrease in concentration with increasing fly weight. This difference is attributed to the different roles of surface adsorption of metals with higher oxidation states and the high absorption efficiencies of those existing as oxidation states 1 and 2. The weight of the insect is therefore a major factor in determining the individual's chemoprint. The implications of this observation for other studies are discussed. © 1989 Plenum Publishing Corporation.},

This study considers combinations of chemical elements as intrinsic markers for tracing resource use by Prostephanus truncatus (Horn) (Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), a pest of stored maize (Zea mays L., Poaceae) which occurs in natural environments where alternative hosts may support reservoirs of infestation. Prostephanus truncatus were laboratory-reared on maize or field-caught in pheromone-baited flight-traps. Beetles and hosts were screened for multiple elements using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). For elements above detection limits, we tested relationships between determinations for various host plants, and for beetles according to environment where captured. An alternative host, Spondias purpurea L. (Anacardiaceae), contained more Al, B, Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Si, and Sr than maize, and less P and Zn. Elemental profiles of beetles were associated with environment, with significantly lower Al, Ca, Cu, Cr, Fe, P, S, Si, Sr, Ti, and Zn determinations in maize-reared beetles than in beetles captured in agricultural or natural environments. Additionally, Al, Ba, K, P, Sr, and Ti determinations of field beetles captured in agricultural vs. natural environments were significantly different. This suggests Al, Sr, and Ti as candidate markers for environment, and possibly others as elemental concentrations (except B, Ba, Ni, and P) were significantly different in comparisons of all field-collected vs. maize-reared beetles. We present a robust practical solution which successfully identified combinations of elemental markers for remotely tracing resource use and dispersal by P. truncatus. We discuss the application of chemical characterisation for identifying intrinsic markers of pests, particularly species with alternative hosts. We discuss how to manage the low replication and unbalanced sample sizes inherent in insect elemental screening, particularly when rarer elements are potential markers.},

The concentrations of seven trace elements (Al, Ca, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cr, Sr) in 25 samples reared from five different regions' soils in China were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The results showed significant differences among soil samples and S. litura samples collected from diverse regions in terms of the contents of all elements, respectively. In addition, four elements (Ca, Fe, Zn and Sr) showed significantly correlations (P {\textless} 0.05) between S. litura and soils. Multivariate analysis techniques including principal component analysis and canonical discriminant analysis were utilized to discriminate S. litura samples according to geographical origins using concentrations of trace elements as variables. The recognition accuracy and prediction accuracy were both reach to 100.0\% through cross validation of the results. Therefore, identification pattern on the basis of trace elements in the bodies of S. litura was feasible for the determination of geographical origins of individuals and the applications of this technique could be potentially available to design pest management programs and contribute for resolving invasive insect issues in pest breakout areas in the future.},

Then, different modeling algorithms including orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SLDA), support vector machine (SVM), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) were applied and were compared to obtain the best classification and model. Meanwhile, variable importance analysis (VIP) and 5 kinds of data pre-treatment technologies were investigated for improving the discriminant ability of the model. The results showed FCB and Non-FCB samples could be successfully discriminated by combining chemometric tools, and the OPLS-DA had the best identification effect than others. Meanwhile, it could be found that the VIP analysis could significantly increase the discriminant ability of the model and the discrimination accuracy of models based on UV-scaling was significantly better than others, which proved VIP was a powerful way to select useful variables and proper data pre-treatment technologies were very important for improving the discriminant effect. In addition, according to the best OPLS-DA model (vip-uv-OPLS-DA), the test samples could be successfully predicted with 100\% accuracy, and the validation parameters R2X, R2Y and Q2 were 0.97, 1.0 and 1.0, respectively, which proved the model had powerful discriminant and predictive ability.

	abstract = {Forty-four American ginseng samples originating from three countries, i.e., Canada (n = 10), America (n = 6), and China (n = 28) were collected from the largest herbal medicine market in China. To verify the ability of elemental analysis combined with statistical methods in geographical authentication of American ginseng, concentrations of 15 elements (Cu, Co, Ni, Zn, Fe, Al, Mn, Ti, Rb, Sr, Cd, Ca, Mg, K, and Na) were analyzed, and different multivariate statistical approaches were also applied. In our present study, elemental mean concentrations of Cu, Zn, Co, Fe, Al, Mn, Ti, Rb, Cd, and Ca in ginseng samples from different regions displayed statistical difference (P {\textless} 0.05). Principal component analysis (PCA) extracted three independent principal components (PCs) with eigenvalues higher than 1, and a 3D scatter plot using sample scores of PC1 versus PC2 versus PC3 demonstrated a satisfactory classification of American ginseng samples originated from Canada, America, and China. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) also displayed a high classification rate (100.0\%) of ginseng samples from different countries, and satisfactory predictive ability (93.2\%) using the cross-validate discriminant analysis was achieved. Our present observations suggest that element analysis together with chemometric analysis can be a reliable method in the origin determination of American ginseng.},

	abstract = {Determining the geographical origin of specialty fruits imported into China is important to protect the legitimate rights and interests of consumers against mislabeled origin fruits and may provide a regulatory tool to verify fruit sold into international markets. This study aims to establish an accurate and effective method to identify the geographical origin of south-east Asian durian, which could be further used to improve the traceability of similar imported fruits. In this study, 73 durian were collected from Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam. We analyzed durian core and pulp using five stable isotopes (δ15N, δ13C, δ34S, δ2H and δ18O) and elemental contents: nitrogen (\% N), carbon (\% C) and sulfur (\% S). Two way-ANOVA (two-way analysis of variance) was used to identify major origin differences for each variable. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used as exploratory techniques and classification parametrics. Two way-ANOVA showed significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) between the geographical origin and durian tissue type. The durian core afforded better origin traceability than durian pulp. LDA achieved durian origin accuracy rates of 98.6 \% and 97.3 \% for the testing and training sets respectively by combining stable isotopes and elemental contents. ANN gave higher accuracy rates than LDA, correctly identifying durian origin with an accuracy of 100 \% for the training set, and 94.4 \% on the testing set. This research found stable isotopes and elemental compositions could be used to potentially discriminate the geographical origins of durian from four south-east Asian countries.},

Feathers have been subjected to a number of chemical analyses to study such things as their elemental composition, contaminants, and hormones. The reliance on standard methodology of using concentrations to express quantities of chemical substances is seriously problematic because it creates artifacts by ignoring the physiology of feathers. Some elements and compounds are incorporated into the feather as part of the very building blocks of the keratin. However, others that are less functionally important to feathers (but not necessarily to the bird) enter the developing cells in proportion to their abundance in the bloodstream; in other words, feathers are merely receptacles, and deposition of chemicals is time dependent. In the latter case, one that applies to much of the work done on feather chemistry, data expressed as concentrations are meaningless because the varying mass across the feather alters concentrations in a way that has no biological significance. I discuss this problem and various pitfalls in the chemical analysis of feathers, and offer solutions that ultimately will offer a better understanding of the mechanisms influencing feather composition and, thus, the ecological patterns and processes they were meant to study. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We observed that Cd and Tl content in different growing stages of L. sericata (larvae, puparial cases, and adults) was increasing with increasing metal concentration in the feeding substrate, namely metal-enriched liver. However, patterns of accumulation differed between the two metals investigated, showing a linear relationship for Cd and a saturable pattern for Tl. For cadmium, the highest bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was found in the larval stage (in the range of 0.20–0.25), while for thallium, puparial cases accumulated more metal than the other stages tested (BAF in the range of 0.24–0.42). Thallium was also observed to have a negative effect on larval growth, resulting in lower weight and smaller puparial size. With this study, we update the information on the bioaccumulation of cadmium in forensically important blowflies and provide the first report on the bioaccumulation of thallium as well as its developmental impact in blowflies. Specifically, our results suggest that analysis of puparial cases could yield useful information for entomotoxicological investigations. The content of Cd and Tl in larvae, puparial cases, and adults of L. sericata was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The validation parameters of the method such as sensitivity, detection limits, quantification limits, precision, and accuracy were evaluated. The method detection limit (MDL) for all types of samples was in the range of 1.6–3.4 ng g−1 for Cd and 0.034–0.15 ng g−1 for Tl, and the accuracy of the method was confirmed by a high recovery of metals from certified reference materials (91.3\% for Cd and 94.3\% for Tl).},

Body tissues record the 87Sr/86Sr of bioavailable Sr of ingested food and water. To identify non-local individuals, knowledge of the 87Sr/86Sr of a non-migratory population is required. However, varying factors such as tissue turnover rates, feeding selectivity, Sr content, digestibility of food, and the ingestion of mineral dust can influence body tissue 87Sr/86Sr. To evaluate the Sr contribution of diet and water to mammalian hard tissues 87Sr/86Sr, controlled feeding studies are necessary. Here we present 87Sr/86Sr from controlled feeding experiments with two rodent species (Rattus norvegicus, Cavia porcellus). Due to the continuous and fast incremental growth of rat and guinea pig incisors ({\textasciitilde}0.1 – 0.5 mm/day), their enamel is expected to record isotopic dietary changes. For Experiment-1: Diet Switch, animals were switched from their respective supplier food to a pelleted experimental diet containing either insect-, plant-, or meat-meal and a staggered-sampling approach was used to monitor the 87Sr/86Sr changes in rat incisor enamel and bone over the course of the experiment. In Experiment-2: Basic Diets, separated cohorts (n = 6) of rats and guinea pigs were fed one of the three pelleted diets and received tap water for 54 days. While the rat incisors showed a complete tissue turnover, the slower-growing guinea pig incisors partially retained supplier diet-related isotopic compositions. In addition, one group of rats fed plant-meal pellets received Sr-rich mineral water, demonstrating that drinking water can be an important Sr source in addition to diet. Additionally, a leaching experiment showed that only a small fraction of diet-related Sr is bioavailable. Finally, in Experiment-3: Dust Addition, guinea pigs were fed pellets with and without addition of 4\% of isotopically distinct dust (loess or kaolin). Animals that received kaolin-containing pellets displayed increased enamel 87Sr/86Sr. Intra-population 87Sr/86Sr variability within each feeding group was small and thus we conclude that it should not affect interpretations of 87Sr/86Sr in provenance studies. However, the differences between bulk food and leachate 87Sr/86Sr highlight the importance of Sr bioavailability for provenance studies and Sr isoscapes.},

The elemental composition of 249 adult Brimstone butterflies (Gonepteryx rhamni L.) was studied by wavelength dispersive X‐ray fluorescence spectrometry, to determine whether site/population‐specific differences could be detected. The chemical elements studied were K, Ca, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ti, P, CI and S. Marked differences were found in the chemical composition of the two sexes, and between individuals caught on different sites and in different years and seasons. Multivariate analyses of the data using principal component analysis and canonical variate analysis showed a clear separation of the butterflies by sex, and within each sex, by seasons. Of the elements studied, the main discriminating ones for this butterfly were K, Ca, P, Zn, CI and S. Whilst differences in chemical composition appear to result from variations in the composition of soil and food‐plants in different localities, any site/population‐specific differences are soon masked by the passage of time, as adults age and feed. This makes the technique of limited value in the study of dispersal in this species. Copyright © 1986, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

Here we investigated an unexplored, yet crucial, question relating to whether, and to what degree, metals from two major body fractions: exoskeleton (elytra) and internal (body organs with gut material present in abdomens), are correlated with each other in wild populations of the largest European saproxylic insect, the Stag Beetle Lucanus cervus, and how metals from these two fractions vary with insect size and local habitat conditions. We examined the continent-wide variation in the concentrations of 12 chemical elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, As, Cd, Pb and Ni) measured in the elytra and abdomen of specimens from 28 populations inhabiting an urban-woodland habitat gradient across the species’ entire distributional range from Spain to Russia. Across populations, elemental concentrations (except Ni and Pb) were 2–13 times higher in abdominal samples than in elytra, and the magnitude of these differences was related to both insect size and local habitat conditions. Smaller individuals from both woodland and urban habitat tended to have higher concentrations of trace elements (Zn, As, Cd, Pb and Ni). The concentration of only six elements (Mg, K, Na, Mn, Cd and Ni) was correlated in the elytra and abdomen at the individual and population levels, implying a limitation to the broader applicability of elytra as a surrogate for internal elemental pools. We highlight that in non-feeding adult saproxylic beetles, minerals, acquired during the larval stage, may be concentrated in the large quantities of residual body fat. Our study emphasizes that in non-feeding adult saproxylic beetles, minerals/trace metals, acquired during the larval stage, may be concentrated in the large quantities of residual body fat.},

On the other hand, sexually selected traits are often proposed to indicate “good genes” for resistance, which implies a positive genetic correlation between resistance and success in sexual selection. Here I show that experimental evolution of improved resistance to the intestinal pathogen Pseudomonas entomophila in Drosophila melanogaster was associated with a reduction in male sexual success. Males from four resistant populations achieved lower paternity than males from four susceptible control populations in competition with males from a competitor strain, indicating an evolutionary cost of resistance in terms of mating success and/or sperm competition. In contrast, no costs were found in larval viability, larval competitive ability and population productivity assayed under nutritional limitation; together with earlier studies this suggests that the costs of P. entomophila resistance for nonsexual fitness components are negligible. Thus, rather than indicating heritable pathogen resistance, sexually selected traits expressed in the absence of pathogens may be sensitive to costs of resistance, even if no such costs are detected in other fitness traits.},

Understanding the feeding ecology and dispersal patterns of R.dominica may likely help predict the abundance or movement of this pest in various habitats. Natal sites and movement of insects are studied using intrinsic methods involving elemental analyses. In this study, to understand the dietary history of R.dominica, trace and macro elements were used as potential markers. Insects reared on selected diets under laboratory conditions and adult beetles collected from the periphery of granaries or inside forested woodlands were used to determine 10 different elements in their body tissues. Quantities of 10 elements were also determined in respective laboratory hosts. The main discriminant elements for laboratory-reared R.dominica were Na, S and Zn, while significantly different elements were distinctive among field-collected beetles and included P, Ca, K, Zn, and Cu. The amount of Zn quantified in acorn-fed lab reared beetles was significantly lower than wheat- or corn-fed insects. Similarly, beetles captured in woodlands had significantly lower Zn in their body signatures, suggesting acorn seeds may have served as an alternate host in Quercus spp. dominated woodlands. Our studies showed that elemental profiles may potentially be used as biological markers for delineating food sources of R.dominica to mainly discriminate whether beetles originated in agricultural vs. wooded habitats. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Measuring metal toxicokinetics in organism "individuals"may provide insights into the processes underlying the variabilities. Therefore, we developed a double stable isotope method that can simultaneously measure uptake and elimination of metals in individual organisms and thus the distribution of the toxicokinetic parameters. Specifically, we exposed organisms to both isotopes (113Cd and 114Cd; Cd = cadmium) during the first stage and to only one isotope (114Cd) during the second stage. Metal uptake and elimination rate constants (i.e., ku and ke) were simultaneously estimated from the content of the two isotopes measured in each organism at the end of the second stage. We applied the method to investigate the interindividual variability in Cd concentrations caused by body size in two marine mussel species. Cd concentrations are higher in larger Xenostrobus atratus but lower in smaller Perna viridis. Size-dependent Cd uptake is found to be responsible for size effects on Cd concentrations in the mussels and the interspecies differences in the relationship between Cd concentration and body size. Specifically, Cd ku increases with size in X. atratus (0.057-0.297 L g-1 d-1) but decreases with size in P. viridis (0.155-0.351 L g-1 d-1). In contrast, Cd ke is not influenced by body size (X. atratus: 0.002-0.060 d-1 P. viridis: 0.008-0.060 d-1). Overall, we extended the applicability of the stable isotope methods to measure metal toxicokinetics in "individual"organisms, providing a readily available tool for investigating problems related to metal bioaccumulation.},

	abstract = {Essential and non-essential trace metals are capable of causing toxicity to organisms above a threshold concentration. Extensive research has assessed the behaviour of trace metals in biological and ecological systems, but has typically focused on single organisms within a trophic level and not on multi-trophic transfer through terrestrial food chains. This reinforces the notion of metal toxicity as a closed system, failing to consider one trophic level as a pollution source to another; therefore, obscuring the full extent of ecosystem effects. Given the relatively few studies on trophic transfer of metals, this review has taken a compartment-based approach, where transfer of metals through trophic pathways is considered as a series of linked compartments (soil-plant-arthropod herbivore-arthropod predator). In particular, we consider the mechanisms by which trace metals are taken up by organisms, the forms and transformations that can occur within the organism and the consequences for trace metal availability to the next trophic level. The review focuses on four of the most prevalent metal cations in soil which are labile in terrestrial food chains: Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni. Current knowledge of the processes and mechanisms by which these metals are transformed and moved within and between trophic levels in the soil-plant-arthropod system are evaluated. We demonstrate that the key factors controlling the transfer of trace metals through the soil-plant-arthropod system are the form and location in which the metal occurs in the lower trophic level and the physiological mechanisms of each organism in regulating uptake, transformation, detoxification and transfer. The magnitude of transfer varies considerably depending on the trace metal concerned, as does its toxicity, and we conclude that biomagnification is not a general property of plant-arthropod and arthropod-arthropod systems. To deliver a more holistic assessment of ecosystem toxicity, integrated studies across ecosystem compartments are needed to identify critical pathways that can result in secondary toxicity across terrestrial food-chains.},

	abstract = {The cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (F.) (Coleoptera: Anobiidae) is a pest of durable grain commodities, spices, and stored tobacco. Larvae cause most feeding damage to commodities; adult L. serricorne rarely feed and are good fliers. Since L. serricorne can potentially disperse between different landscapes and may feed on different hosts, understanding insects' host use pattern may help to direct management efforts to specific commodity storages. In this study, quantitative and qualitative differences of carbon and nitrogen isotopes and five inorganic elements (Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn) present in the insect body tissue were used to identify the dietary history of L. serricorne. Adults reared on different hosts in the laboratory, including respective rearing media and insects collected from different field locations, were used in the study. The δ13C values in the laboratory, reared L. serricorne, were similar to the values of respective rearing media with an enrichment of about 1‰ in the insect body. The enrichment for δ15N value greatly increased from host to insect body and varied about +3.30 to +5.73‰ in beetles. There was a distinct difference in δ13C values for insects raised on C3-based or C4-based hosts. A majority of the field-collected beetles showed δ13C values similar to expectations for a C3 plant (-20 to -28‰); however, a few beetles showed evidence for feeding on C4 plants ({\textless}-14‰) or diet mixing between C3 and C4 plants. Of the five inorganic elements evaluated, only Mn showed distinct variation in concentrations between the rearing media and insect body. This study shows potential exists for delineating the food sources of L. serricorne, using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes and elements like Mn. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In birds, a promising yet underutilized tool is the trace elemental composition of feathers. The elemental profile of a feather may reveal information about the geographic origin of a bird provided that molting occurs on the breeding grounds and that elemental differences exist between breeding areas. Here, we explore the use of trace elemental composition in body feathers of the Puget Sound white-crowned sparrow Zonotrichia leucophrys pugetensis as a tool (1) to discriminate among birds collected in four different song dialect populations along a 400-km stretch of the Pacific Northwest coast and (2) to assign males singing nonlocal dialects in one population to potential natal populations. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry detected 34 trace elements in sampled feathers and in a discriminant function analysis seven of these elements differed among the four source populations. Half of the six nonlocal dialect singers, who were likely to have immigrated into the focal population, were assigned to a population that matched their song dialect. Our study suggests that feather microchemistry is a promising tool for identifying geographic origins of dispersing birds over small geographic scales and in combination with other markers, such as song, may give insight into ecological and evolutionary processes. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The European Starling (Sturnidae: Sturnus vulgaris L.) is an invasive bird in North America where it is an agricultural pest. In British Columbia (Canada), the starling population increases in orchards and vineyards in autumn, where they consume and damage ripening fruits. Starlings also cause damage in dairy farms and feedlots by consuming and contaminating food and spreading diseases. Damage can be partly mitigated by the use of scare devices, which can disperse flocks until they become habituated. Large-scale trapping and euthanizing before starlings move to fields and farms could be a practical means of preventing damage, but requires knowledge of natal origin. Within a small (20,831 km2), agriculturally significant portion of south-central British Columbia, the Okanagan-Similkameen region, we used 21 trace elements in bone tissue to discriminate the spatial distribution of juvenile starlings and to reveal the geographic origin of the problem birds in fall. Stepwise discriminant analysis of trace elements classified juveniles to their natal origin (minimum discrimination distance of 12 km) with 79\% accuracy. In vineyards and orchards, the majority (55\%) of problem birds derive from northern portions of the valley; and the remaining 45\% of problem birds were a mixture of local and immigrant/unassigned birds. In contrast, problem birds in dairy farms and feedlots were largely immigrants/unassigned (89\%) and 11\% were local from northern region of the valley. Moreover, elemental signatures can separate starling populations in the Valley yielding a promising tool for identifying the geographic origin of these migratory birds.},

The possibility of heavy metal accumulation by such helminths was also investigated. A total of 202 C. ocellatus were collected from three different sites (industrial, rural, and urban systems) in Ismailia governorate, Egypt, during summer 2009. The lizards were classified according to their sex and size and were examined for the intestinal helminths. Heavy metal levels were detected in the intestinal tissue of the lizards and the recovered helminths. Species richness was 6, 5, and 3 in rural, urban, and industrial systems, respectively. Significant site variations regarding infection prevalence, intensity, and abundance were encountered at different levels. Some noticeable effects of the host size were found. The significant differences found between the metal levels of the intestinal tissues and the recovered helminths and the other relations found in this study may be indications for a possible metals accumulation capacity by helminths. The cestode Oochoristica tuberculata could be a promising biomonitor for Cu and Pb, while the intestinal nematodes were less sensitive to the pollution. Differences in the accumulation capacity may be attributed to the intensity of infection, parasite species, and metal. The observed patterns of distribution and occurrence of helminths and the metals accumulation capacity reflect the need for more studies since this study proposes the model intestinal helminth/C. ocellatus as another promising bioindication system in the terrestrial habitat, especially in areas where the lizard C. ocellatus are available. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

For example, host specificity influences parasite dynamics, but is unclear how adaptation of parasites to local host communities may scale up to continental distributions. Here, we develop a macroecological framework to determine how host community structure affects the distribution of specialist and generalist populations of Striga hermonthica, an African parasitic plant of cereal crops. Combining data from global crop production and parasite experimental trials, we find that parasites perform best on the host species that is most common in their location of origin. Moreover, niche model contrasts predict parasite specialization on two hosts that evolved alongside Striga during domestication (pearl millet and sorghum), indicating that specialist parasites may be most likely to occur where host niches differ most in multivariate environmental space. Our study demonstrates that patterns of parasite local adaptation to host communities can emerge at continental scales and that differential environmental tolerances of hosts indirectly shape the distribution of specialist and generalist parasites. By predicting spatial dynamics of parasite specialization versus generalization directly from environmental data, our approach may help inform current and future management of pests and disease.},

	abstract = {In toxicology studies, the use of death as an endpoint often fails to capture the effects a pollutant has on disruptions of ecosystem services by changing an animal's behavior. Many toxicants can cause population extinctions of insect species at concentrations well below the EC25, EC50, or EC90 concentrations traditionally reported from short-term bioassays. A surprising number of species cannot detect metal and metalloid contamination, and do not always avoid food with significant metal concentrations. This frequently leads to modified ingestion, locomotor, and reproductive behaviors. For example, some species show a tendency to increase locomotor behaviors to escape from locations with elevated metal pollution, whereas other insects greatly decrease all movements unrelated to feeding. Still others exhibit behaviors resulting in increased susceptibility to predation, including a positive phototaxis causing immatures to move to exposed positions. For purposes of reproduction, the inability to avoid even moderately polluted sites when ovipositing can lead to egg loss and reduced fitness of offspring. Ultimately, impaired behaviors result in a general reduction in population sizes and species diversity at contaminated sites, the exceptions being those species tolerating contamination that become dominant. Regardless, ecosystem services, such as herbivory, detritus reduction, or food production for higher trophic levels, are disrupted. This review evaluates the effects of metal and metalloid pollution on insect behaviors in both terrestrial and aquatic systems reported in a diverse literature scattered across many scientific disciplines. Behaviors are grouped by ingestion, taxis, and oviposition. We conclude that understanding how insect behavior is modified is necessary to assess the full scope and importance of metal and metalloid contamination. © 2010 The Authors.

We used stable isotopes (δ34S, δ13C, δ15N, δ2H) in primary feathers and a combined Bayesian assignment and isotopic threshold model to identify feather origins and the potential winter use of aquaculture (δ34S {\textless} 10‰, δ13C {\textgreater} -14‰), freshwater (δ34S {\textless} 10‰, δ13C {\textless} -20‰), and marine habitats (δ34S {\textgreater} 10‰).

	abstract = {Insects encounter a variety of metals in their environment, many of which are required at some concentration for normal organismal homeostasis, but essentially all of which are toxic at higher concentrations. Insects have evolved a variety of genetic, and likely epigenetic, mechanisms to deal with metal stress. A recurring theme in all these systems is complexity and diversity; even simple, single gene, cases are complex. Of the known gene families, the metallothioneins are perhaps the best understood and provide good examples of how diverse metal response is. Interestingly, there is considerable diversity across taxa in these metal-responsive systems, including duplications to form small gene families and complex expression of single loci. Strikingly, different species have evolved different mechanisms to cope with the same, or similar, stress suggesting both independent derivation of, and plasticity in, the pathways involved. It is likely that some metal-response systems evolved early in evolutionary time and have been conserved, while others have diverged, and still others evolved more recently and convergently. In addition to conventional genetics, insects likely respond to environmental metal through a variety of epigenetic systems, but direct tests are lacking. Ultimately, it is likely that classical genetic and epigenetic factors interact in regulating insect metal responses. In light of this diversity across species, future studies including a broad-based examination of gene expression in non-model species in complex environments will likely uncover additional genes and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Stable-hydrogen isotope measurements (δD) of biological tissues have gained widespread acceptance in wildlife and forensic studies, especially in tracking geographical movements of birds and other species. Continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry enables high-throughput δD analyses to be conducted on tissue samples as small as 0.15 mg, compared with conventional offline analyses that require 7-10 mg. This reduction in sample size has raised concerns regarding intra-sample hydrogen isotopic variance due to potential biological heterogeneities that could exceed interpretations of geospatial origin. To help resolve this, feathers were obtained from captive birds to examine isotopic variance expected due to sample size, location, and heterogeneity factors, and from selected wild birds to examine isotopic variance due to these and to additional dietary or location changes during feather growth. Captive bird feathers were sub-sampled along the vane on either side of a single feather at masses of 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.6, 1.0 and 2.0 mg, and along the rachis. The results showed consistency of feather δD measurements across a wide range of sample masses. Within-feather δD isotopic variance for captive and some wild birds was as low as ±3‰ for vane material, which corresponds to a geospatial resolution of about 1 degree of latitude in central North America. Intrasample variance for the rachis was ±5‰, with lower δD values for both wild and captive birds. However, given the extraordinary intra-feather δD variance observed in some wild species, we recommend researchers first carefully assess the degree of intra- and inter-sample hydrogen isotopic variation in the selected tissue growth period for the species of interest before geospatial interpretations of origin are attempted.

	abstract = {RATIONALE The supply of NBS 30 biotite is nearly exhausted. During measurements of NBS 30 and potential replacements, reproducible δ2HVSMOW-SLAP values could not be obtained by three laboratories using high-temperature conversion (HTC) systems. The cause of this issue has been investigated using the silver-tube technique for hydrogen-isotope measurements of water. METHODS The δ2HVSMOW-SLAP values of NBS 30 biotite, other biotites, muscovites, and kaolinite with different particle sizes, along with IAEA-CH-7 polyethylene, and reference waters and NBS 22 oil that were sealed in silver-tube segments, were measured. The effect of absorbed water on mineral surfaces was investigated with waters both enriched and depleted in 2H. The quantitative conversion of hydrogen from biotite into gaseous hydrogen as a function of mass and particle size was also investigated. RESULTS The δ2H VSMOW-SLAP values of NBS 30 obtained by three laboratories were as much as 21 ‰ too high compared with the accepted value of -65.7 ‰, determined by conventional off-line measurements. The experiments showed a strong correlation between grain size and the δ2H VSMOW-SLAP value of NBS 30 biotite, but not of biotites with lower iron content. The δ2HVSMOW-SLAP values of NBS 30 as a function of particle size show a clear trend toward -65.7 ‰ with finer grain size. CONCLUSIONS Determination of the δ2H VSMOW-SLAP values of hydrous minerals and of NBS 30 biotite by on-line HTC systems coupled to isotope-ratio mass spectrometers may be unreliable because hydrogen in this biotite may not be converted quantitatively into molecular hydrogen. Extreme caution in the use and interpretation of δ2HVSMOW-SLAP on-line measurements of hydrous minerals is recommended. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.hn Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Evidence was sought for elements less affected by contamination and potentially indicative of biogenic activity. The unique combination of surface sensitivity, spatial resolution, and detection limits used here has provided new insight regarding hair analysis. Metals such as Ca, Fe, and Pb appeared to have little representative value of endogenous uptake and were mainly due to contamination. Cu and Zn, however, demonstrate behaviors worthy of further investigation into relating hair concentrations to endogenous function. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

In the present work, a systematic review on the relation between the mineral composition of hair and the physical or mental disorders is discussed. Detailed information of examined populations, methods of sample preparations and analytical techniques are presented. Methods: A systematic literature search in four electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Medline (from 1997 to 2012/01/31) for English language articles was performed. In addition, a reference list and manual search was undertaken. Results: The following number of studies was included: 66. Most of the authors reported that there exists a correlation between deficiency or excess of some elements in hair and occurrence of some diseases, such as: autism, cancer, hypertension, myocardial infarction, kidney disease and diabetes mellitus. However, not all results were consistent. Conclusions: Most of the authors concluded that the profile of hair mineral imbalance might be useful as a diagnostic tool for the early diagnosis of many diseases. However, it seems that there is a need to standardize sample preparation procedures, in particular washing and mineralization methods. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

However, in many instances, especially for elemental or ‘mineral’ analysis, the degree of success of analytical interpretation has been quite minimal with respect to the extent of such endeavors. In this critical review we address the questions surrounding hair analysis with specific intent of discovering what hair concentrations can actually relate to in a biogenic sense. This is done from a chemistry perspective to explain why and how elements are incorporated into hair and their meaning. This includes an overview of variables attributed to altering hair concentrations, such as age, gender, melanin content, and other less reported factors. Hair elemental concentrations are reviewed with regard to morbidity, with specific examples of disease related effects summarized. The application of hair analysis for epidemiology and etiology studies is enforced. A section is dedicated specifically to the area of population studies with regards to mercury, which highlights how endogenous and exogenous incorporation relies on species dependant metabolism and metabolic products. Many of the considerations are relevant to other areas of interest in hair analysis, such as for drug and isotopic analysis. Inclusion of a table of elemental concentrations in hair should act as a valuable reference (298 references). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {The functional role and commercial importance of insect pigments have been studied for well over a century. They are classified into those synthesized by insects, which include anthraquinones, aphins, pterins, tetrapyrroles, ommochromes, melanins and papiliochromes, and those sequestered from their host plants, the antioxidative carotenoids and water-soluble flavonoids. They can also be categorized into those that are produced by cyclization of linear precursors, e.g. anthraquinones, aphins and tetrapyrroles and those derived from cyclic precursors such as pterins, ommochromes, melanins and anthocyanins. Anthraquinones and aphins are derived by cyclization of linear polyketides via successive condensation of simple carboxylic acid metabolites and occur in two major Superfamilies of Hemiptera, the Coccoidea and Aphidoidae, respectively. Ommochromes, tetrapyrroles and melanins are derived from different amino acid precursors, tryptophan, glycine and tyrosine, respectively. Apart from providing body colouration, ommochromes are visual pigments, melanins act as a protectant against UV and tetrapyrroles facilitate oxygen transport to cells. Papiliochromes are synthesized using both, the essential amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan. Pterins are derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and are also present in ommatidia of eyes. The sequestered pigments, anthocyanins and carotenoids, are synthesized from phenylalanine and by condensation of two isoprene units, respectively, in plants. The biosyntheses of chemochromes in insects are governed by a complex set of enzymes, pathways and genetics. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecules that are not only responsible for the striking colours but also provide functional benefits for insects.

We found unexpected Ni kinetics in metal-exposed adult and larval beetles. Instead of the pattern observed commonly for other metals, i.e., an increase in metal concentration followed by stabilisation in the uptake phase and a decrease after transfer to uncontaminated food, the Ni-fed beetles apparently switched to decontamination soon after the start of Ni exposure while they were still being fed Ni-spiked food. In addition, internal body Ni concentrations showed high variance. The traditional first-order, one-compartment model with the switch to decontamination set to the last day of the uptake phase appeared inadequate and in most cases was nonsignificant. Instead, the model with a regression-estimated point of switching to decontamination fit the data better, explaining 57.2-91.5\% of the temporal variability of mean Ni body concentrations (weighted regression) in adult beetles and 44.1-62.3\% in larvae. Temperature did not affect Ni toxicokinetics in adults, but in larvae there were some temperature-dependent differences in kinetic parameters. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It is often used as a group name for metals and semimetals (metalloids) that have been associated with contamination and potential toxicity or ecotoxicity. At the same time, legal regulations often specify a list of "heavy metals" to which they apply. Such lists differ from one set of regulations to another and the term is sometimes used without even specifying which "heavy metals" are covered. However, there is no authoritative definition to be found in the relevant literature. There is a tendency, unsupported by the facts, to assume that all so-called "heavy metals" and their compounds have highly toxic or ecotoxic properties. This has no basis in chemical or toxicological data. Thus, the term "heavy metals" is both meaningless and misleading. Even the term "metal" is commonly misused in both toxicological literature and in legislation to mean the pure metal and all the chemical species in which it may exist. This usage implies that the pure metal and all its compounds have the same physicochemical, biological, and toxicological properties, which is untrue. In order to avoid the use of the term "heavy metal", a new classification based on the periodic table is needed. Such a classification should reflect our understanding of the chemical basis of toxicity and allow toxic effects to be predicted.},

We also explore the integration of strontium isotope research with other types of paleoecological or archaeology data, as well as with evidence and interpretative frameworks from other fields (such as conservation ecology, conservation paleobiology or history). This blending is critical as we seek to advance the field beyond simply distinguishing local or relatively sedentary individuals from those that were non-local or highly mobile.

The distribution of each parasite taxon depends, to varying degrees, on individual host traits (e.g., mass, diet) and on host-population characteristics (e.g., lake size, mean host mass, mean diet).

This annual multi-generational migration cycle, like many seasonal natural phenomena, may be impacted by recent changes in climate and habitat. We investigated long-term trends in monarch abundance and fall migration timing over a 29-year period in Cape May, New Jersey, using data collected from daily population surveys designed to track patterns of occurrence during the fall migration period through Cape May (1 Sept–31 Oct). Between 1992 and 2020, the migration midpoint, average peak migration day and first peak migration day shifted between 16 and 19 days later in the season, an average of approximately six days per decade. This observed shift in migration timing is correlated with increasing temperatures in September and October in northeastern monarch breeding grounds over the study period. Our data do not demonstrate a significant directional trend in monarch abundance over the study period, yet population data collected at overwintering sites in Mexico indicate a substantial decline over the same period. Further postponement of fall migration may lead to lower migration success and exacerbate the overall decline of this iconic species.},

Nearly 3,000 genes were differentially expressed between strong and weak flying beetles, while weak fliers and nonfliers did not significantly differ. The differentially expressed genes were mainly associated with lipid metabolism, muscle maintenance, oxidative stress response, detoxification, endocrine function, and flight behavior. Three variant loci, two in the coding region of genes, were significantly associated with flight capacity but these genes had no known functional link to flight. Several differentially expressed gene systems may be important for sustained flight, while other systems are downregulated during dispersal and likely to conserve energy before host colonization.

We examined the evolutionary patterns for a set of 91 canonical immune genes of North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), using as an outgroup the closely related soldier butterfly (Danaus eresimus). As a comparison to these immune genes, we selected a set of control genes that were paired with each immune for approximate size and genomic location. As a whole, these immune genes had a significant but modest reduction in Tajima's D relative to paired-control genes, but otherwise did not show distinct patterns of population genetic variation or evolutionary rates. When further partitioning these immune genes into four functional classes (recognition, signalling, modulation, and effector), we found distinct differences among these groups. Relative to control genes, recognition genes exhibit increased nonsynonymous diversity and divergence, suggesting reduced constraints on evolution, and supporting the notion that coevolution with pathogens results in diversifying selection. In contrast, signalling genes showed an opposite pattern of reduced diversity and divergence, suggesting evolutionary constraints and conservation. Modulator and effector genes showed no statistical differences from controls. These results are consistent with patterns found in immune genes in fruit flies and Pieris butterflies, suggesting that consistent selective pressures on different classes of immune genes broadly govern the evolution of innate immunity among insects.},

Here, we characterize a locus that consistently displays high divergence among Heliconius butterflies and acts as an introgression hotspot. We further show that this locus contains multiple genes related to locomotion and conserved in Lepidoptera. In light of these findings, we consider that locomotion traits may be under selection, and if these are heritable traits that are selected for, then they might act as species barriers.},

	abstract = {Honey from Apis mellifera is a useful and inexpensive biomonitor for mapping metal distributions in urban centers. The sampling resolution of a biomonitoring survey (e.g., city versus global scale) determines which geochemical processes are reflected in the results. This study presents Pb isotopic compositions and metal concentrations in honey from around the world, sampled at varying resolutions: honey from Canada (n = 21), the United States (n = 111), Belgium (n = 25), and New Zealand (n = 10), with additional samples from Afghanistan, Brazil, Cuba, Germany, Liberia, Taiwan, and Turkey. Honey was sampled at high resolution in two uniquely different land-use settings (New York Metro Area and the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi), at regional-scale resolution in eastern North America (including the Great Lakes region), and Pb isotopic compositions of all samples were compared on a global scale. At high sampling resolution, metal concentrations in honey reveal spatially significant concentration gradients: in New York City, metals associated with human activity and city infrastructure (e.g., Pb, Sb, Ti, V) are more concentrated in honey collected within the city compared to honey from upstate New York, and metal concentrations in honey from Kauaʻi suggest polluting effects of nearby agricultural operations. At lower resolution (regional and global scales), lead isotopic compositions of honey are more useful than metal concentrations in revealing large-scale Pb processes (e.g., the enduring legacy of global leaded gasoline use throughout the twentieth century) and the continental origin of the honey. Lead isotopic compositions of honey collected from N. America (especially from the eastern USA) are more radiogenic (206Pb/207Pb: 1.132–1.253, 208Pb/206Pb: 2.001–2.129) compared to European honey, and honey from New Zealand, which has the least radiogenic isotopic compositions measured in this study (206Pb/207Pb: 1.077–1.160, 208Pb/206Pb: 2.090–2.187). Thus, biomonitoring using honey at different resolutions reflects differing processes and, to some extent, a honey terroir defined by the Pb isotopic composition. The data presented here provide important (and current) global context for future studies that utilize Pb isotopes in honey. Moreover, this study exhibits community science in action, as most of the honey was collected by collaborators around the world, working directly with local apiarists and hobby beekeepers.},

	abstract = {California's Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65) was designed to protect the state's populace from exposures to toxic levels of chemicals in consumer products, including foods, by requiring businesses to warn the public about any of those hazards. There is, however, one qualification in the legislation, which is that warnings are not required if the source of that contamination is natural, as opposed to industrial. That qualification is especially problematic for lead because "natural"and "industrial"lead have a common origin and behave the same in the environment and industrial lead contamination has been pandemic for millennia. As a result of that historic and ongoing contamination, ambient lead levels in the biosphere may be orders of magnitude above natural levels, limiting comparisons of "natural"versus "industrial"lead concentrations in products. Further complicating those comparisons are reports of erroneously high measurements of lead concentrations in the biosphere as a result of sample contamination during collection, storage, and analysis. Some of those problems may be addressed with measurements of lead concentrations using rigorous trace metal clean techniques. These techniques often yield lead concentrations that are below the Act's maximum exposure in foods and non-foods of 0.5 μg/day, eliminating the need for a public alert. Those techniques have also been used to derive natural lead concentrations in a few organisms (marine fish, humans, rats, and dandelions), which range from 2- to 100-fold below ambient levels. However, extrapolating from those few determinations to establish natural lead levels in other organisms is complicated and often inappropriate. Complementary stable lead isotopic composition measurements have also been used to estimate the percent of natural and industrial lead in some consumer products, including foods, wine, and dietary supplements. These measurements, however, require the isotopic compositions of both the "natural"and "industrial"lead end members, which may be poorly defined. In addition, the global market has further complicated identification of the "industrial"lead end member, because lead contamination of foods can occur during production, harvesting, storage, shipping, processing, and packaging, which can happen in different locales within a country, different countries, and even different continents.},

Element concentrations were determined in the whole body and separately in the head, thorax and abdomen using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). The changes in essential element concentration and speciation during metamorphosis were also studied using size exclusion chromatography followed by AAS and proteomic analysis. In both species, the essential elements were more concentrated in the abdomen due to the presence of fat bodies. Magnesium, Fe and Zn concentrations were significantly higher in V. crabro than in V. velutina and could have been related to the higher aerobic energy demand of the former species required to sustain foraging flight. Low concentrations of Cd and Pb were indicative of low environmental exposure. The concentration and speciation of essential elements, particularly Fe, varied among the developmental stages, indicating a modification of ligand preferences during metamorphosis. Overall, the results in the present study provide a better understanding of the hornet metal metabolism and a foundation for additional studies.},

Asian industrial emissions are currently the dominant Pb sources in the northwest and central Pacific Ocean. This study investigated major Pb sources in the northeast Pacific Ocean (inland, coastal, and open ocean), where no comprehensive data exist currently. We measured Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions of a variety of shellfish and fish collected in British Columbia (BC) and used them for Pb source apportionment applications in the marine environment. We identified a clear trend in Pb isotopic compositions, from higher 206Pb/207Pb in inland fish to lower 206Pb/207Pb in open ocean fish, with coastal fish possessing mid-range values. These results indicate that natural sources of Pb dominate freshwater ecosystems in the central BC coast, whereas anthropogenic Pb sources prevail in western North America and the northeast Pacific. Pacific herring that forage along BC coast exhibit Pb isotopic composition that deviates toward the Chinese Pb regression line. We estimate an Asian origin for about one third of their total Pb. This study shows that Pb isotopes in aquatic organisms are valuable tools for assessing Pb sources across coastal and offshore regions of the northeast Pacific, with great potential for identifying primary foraging areas of marine organisms.},

This indicates the high prevalence of industry, as well as the low natural contributions of Cd from North Atlantic waters in both regions. Thus, the significance of anthropogenic Cd sources is similar. These significant anthropogenic contributions are identified for bivalves with a large range in tissue Cd concentrations. Importantly, French bivalves from the Gironde estuary and Marennes-Oléron basin (regions of historic and modern importance for oyster farming, respectively) exhibited the highest Cd levels of the study. Their Cd isotopic signatures indicate historical smelting emissions remain the primary Cd source despite the cessation of local smelting activities in 1986 and subsequent remedial efforts. No significant variability is observed in the δ66Zn values of the French bivalves ({\textasciitilde}0.53‰), with the exception of the much heavier compositions exhibited by oysters from the polluted Gironde estuary (1.19-1.27‰). Lead isotopes do not fractionate during processing like Cd and Zn. They can, therefore, be used to identify emissions from industrial processes and the consumption of unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel as metal sources to French bivalves.Cadmium and Zn isotopes are successfully used here as tracers of anthropogenic processing emissions and are combined with Pb isotope "fingerprinting" techniques to identify metal sources. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Signal profiles for 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb and 208Pb display mass dependent radial and axial distributions in the plasma. In radial profiles lighter isotopes exhibit greater dispersal from the plasma axis than heavier isotopes, in agreement with ICP-MS elemental observations. However, signal maxima (I max) for heavier Pb isotopes occur closer to the load coil than I max for lighter Pb isotopes, the reverse of ICP-MS elemental observations. These mass dependent distributions predict that the radial dispersion and axial I max locations for 203Tl and 205Tl isotopes should occur interspersed with the values for simultaneously measured Pb isotopes. Instead however, their values are appropriate for masses greater that 208Pb, indicating that the observed profiles are not the product of a single stage mass dependent process and that other element properties also effect the distributions. Isotope ratio (and thus mass bias) variation with sampling depth reflects both the mass dependent separation of the numerator and denominator isotope I max along the axis of the plasma and the distance along the axis of the plasma over which the isotope signals are distributed. Addition of matrix to the plasma significantly reduces the variability of these two characteristics suggesting that more accurate correction of instrumental mass bias and more accurate normalization of sample ratios to standard values could be achieved by addition of a common matrix to samples and standards. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.},

However, it has recently been shown that agricultural lime can have a substantial impact on the 87Sr/86Sr ratio and strontium concentration in surface water in areas where soils are low- to non-calcareous. Agricultural lime is rich in strontium with low 87Sr/86Sr ratios, such that interpretations of prehistoric migration based on surface waters affected by agricultural lime often overestimate the number of migrants in a given area. However, the impact of agricultural lime was questioned in a new study, which argues that strontium derived from agricultural lime is retained in the topsoil of the fields and therefore do not contaminate the surface water. In the present study and in a companion study in this volume, we show that strontium derived from agricultural lime is highly mobile in soils, and so contaminate surface waters extensively. We also show that the 87Sr/86Sr ratios are consistently higher in waters from “pristine areas” (where no agricultural lime has been applied within a distance of 150 m from the sample locality) than in water from farmland, thus confirming that it is of vital importance for accurate mapping of isoscapes to avoid sampling waters contaminated by agricultural lime. Our new measurements of 87Sr/86Sr ratios in central Jutland, Denmark, raise the highest measured values to 0.7186. High values between 0.7140 and 0.7156 occur repeatedly and it is apparent that nearly all prehistoric human finds in Jutland, previously believed to have journeyed from afar are more likely of local origin. Furthermore, we show that carbonate-rich areas along the coast of southwest Zealand carry high 87Sr/86Sr values (0.7112–0.7132), where we would expect low values. This surprising result indicates that nearly all humans buried at the Viking Age site, Trelleborg could well have originated locally, in contrast to past studies, which have suggested that about 50\% of the burials were of individuals who came from afar.},

We present a novel combination of strontium isotope analyses performed on the over 3000 year old "Skrydstrup Woman" from Denmark, for whom we compiled a highly detailed month-scale model of her migration timeline. When combined with physical anthropological analyses this timeline can be related to the chronological age at which the residential location changed. We conducted a series of high-resolution strontium isotope analyses of hard and soft human tissues and combined these with anthropological investigations including CT-scanning and 3D visualizations. The Skrydstrup Woman lived during a pan-European period characterized by technical innovation and great social transformations stimulated by long-distance connections; consequently she represents an important part of both Danish and European prehistory. Our multidisciplinary study involves complementary biochemical, biomolecular and microscopy analyses of her scalp hair. Our results reveal that the Skrydstrup Woman was between 17-18 years old when she died, and that she moved from her place of origin -outside present day Denmark-to the Skrydstrup area in Denmark 47 to 42 months before she died. Hence, she was between 13 to 14 years old when she migrated to and resided in the area around Skrydstrup for the rest of her life. From an archaeological standpoint, this one-time and one-way movement of an elite female during the possible "age of marriageability" might suggest that she migrated with the aim of establishing an alliance between chiefdoms. Consequently, this detailed multidisciplinary investigation provides a novel tool to reconstruct high resolution chronology of individual mobility with the perspective of studying complex patterns of social and economic interaction in prehistory.},

	abstract = {In this paper Sr isotope signatures are reported for 192 surface water (lakes/ponds and rivers/creeks) samples from within Denmark and an isotope distribution map is presented that may serve as a base for provenance applications, including archaeological migration studies, ground water - surface water - seawater interaction/contamination monitoring, and potentially for agricultural applications, including cases of authenticity proof for particular food products. The Sr isotopic compositions of surface waters range from 87Sr/86Sr=0.7078 to 0.7125 (average 0.7096±0.0016; 2σ). This average value lies above the range of 87Sr/86Sr values between 0.7078 and 0.7082 expected from Late Cretaceous to Early Tertiary (Oligocene) limestones which form the dominant bedrock type in a NW-SE trending belt in Denmark. The elevated 87Sr/86Sr signatures {\textgreater}∼0.7095 are explained by additions to the surface waters of radiogenic Sr predominantly derived from the near-surface weathering and wash-out of Quarternary glaciogenic tills and soils deposited and formed during and after the last two ice age stages (Saale and Weichsel). The Sr isotopic compositions and concentrations of the surface waters can, therefore, best be modeled by a two-component mixing involving carbonaceous bedrock and glaciogenic cover sediments as the two predominant Sr sources. A feasibility study for using Sr isotopic compositions of surface waters as a proxy for bio-available Sr signatures was conducted in a representative test area on Zealand (Land of Legends, Lejre) where there is no use and application of commercial fertilizers. It is demonstrated that the Sr isotopic signatures of lake waters from within this area are slightly higher (but statistically still indistinguishable) from the average value defined by snail shells and soil leachates considered to characterize the true bio-available Sr. In combination with results from other studies, this is interpreted to reflect the wash-out of Sr with a higher 87Sr/86Sr signature released by weathering in the topsoils into the saturated water tables, a component which is consequently not readily transferred into the shallow-rooting plants and into small herbivores feeding on them. Since drinking water is a likely important source of Sr uptake of humans and larger animals, the contention is that a surface water isotopic composition can potentially characterize the bio-available component relevant for human and carnivorous large animals. Spline functions and ordinary linear kriging were used for modeling the geographic distribution of bio-available Sr isotopes over territorial Denmark. As expected, based on the two-source mixing scenario, the water 87Sr/86Sr ratio contour maps (with some notable exceptions) neither mirror the pre-Quarternary bedrock geology nor a (Pleistocene) soil-type distribution map of Denmark. As a conservative suggestion, the use of the average 87Sr/86Sr ratio of 0.7096±0.0015 (2σ) is recommended as an average for bio-available Sr from within Denmark (Bornholm excluded) for human and larger animals and as a confidence band for distinguishing "local" from "non-local" signatures in archaeological provenance studies. The study also reveals that the average 87Sr/86Sr ratio of ∼0.7088 defined from soil extracts and small herbivores lies approximately 0.15\% lower than that defined by the surface waters. The authors recommend using this lower value as a "local" -" non-local" discriminator for food and plant authenticity control in agricultural applications. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report the Sr isotope signatures, and Sr, Al and Na concentrations of 30 surface waters (lakes/ponds and rivers/creeks) and 19 soil sample extracts from the island of Bornholm (Denmark) and present a categorized 87Sr/86Sr value distribution map that may serve as a base for provenance studies, including archaeological migration and authenticity proof for particular food products. The Sr isotopic compositions of surface waters range from 87Sr/86Sr=0.7097-0.7281 (average 0.7175±0.0049; 1σ), whereas 0.1M HNO3, 0.05M HNO3, and 0.01M CaCl2 soil extracts range from 87Sr/86Sr=0.7095-0.7197 and define somewhat lower but statistically indistinguishable averages of 0.7125±0.003 (1s). These compositions are lower than the values expected from the Precambrian granitoid basement (87Sr/86Sr=0.758-0.944), and from the overlying, mainly clastic Paleozoic sediments. Combined Sr isotope composition vs. Sr, Na and Al concentration relationships of soil extracts imply that lowering of the isotopic composition of leachable Sr on Bornholm results as a consequence of significant admixture to this fraction of Sr deposited as marine salts (aerosols), and that rainwater only has a minor influence on the Sr budget of the surface waters. Positively correlated Al/Na and [1/Sr] vs. 87Sr/86Sr relationships in soil extracts and surface waters indicate that the surface run-off on Bornholm is characterized by two predominant sources, namely marine aerosols (sea salts) with high Sr and low 87Sr/86Sr values, and a source with lower [Sr] delivering radiogenic Sr to the surface waters, which we equate with Sr leached from the products of mineral weathering (soils).A feasibility study for using Sr isotopic compositions of surface waters and soil extracts as a proxy for bioavailable Sr signatures was performed with a few samples collected in the vicinity of the eleventh century AD Ndr. Grødbygård cemetery site in SW Bornholm, from where Sr isotope compositions of modern fauna samples and tooth enamel of humans buried in the cemetery have been reported. Waters and soil extracts studied herein from around this site range from 87Sr/86Sr=0.7104-0.7166 and correspond to Sr compositions extracted from snail shells in this area which span a range of 87Sr/86Sr=0.7095-0.7160. Some human tooth enamel is characterized by more radiogenic values (87Sr/86Sr up to 0.718) which points to a possible provenance of these humans from the granite-gneiss terrain in the north of the island and/or to immigration of these humans in their childhood from other places (for example from mainland Sweden) to Bornholm. If the total compositional range of 87Sr/86Sr=0.709-0.718 (n=44) recorded in human enamel from the Ndr. Grødbygård site is considered representative for the variation of bioavailable Sr on Bornholm, then our soil leachate and surface water data entirely covers this range. We therefore propose that the combination of Sr isotope analyses of surface waters and soil leachates are an easy, fast and relatively cost efficient way to characterize a local bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr signature, and consequently propose that the overall average of 87Sr/86Sr=0.7153±0.0048 (1σ; n=50) can be taken as a band for bioavailable Sr fractions suitable to discriminate between local and non-local signatures in provenance studies in the field of archaeology and for food and plant authenticity control in agricultural applications. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Water-rock interactions in aquifer systems are a key control on water quality but remain poorly understood. Lithium (Li) isotopes are useful for understanding water-rock interactions, but there are few data available for groundwater aquifers. Here we present a Li isotope dataset for rainfall and groundwater samples from a carbonate island aquifer system: Rottnest Island, Western Australia. This dataset was complemented by strontium (Sr) isotope and major and trace element data for groundwaters, and leaching experiments on bedrock samples. The δ7Li values and 87Sr/86Sr ratios of fresh groundwaters ranged from +23 to +36‰ and 0.709167 to 0.709198, respectively. Mass balance calculations indicated that silicate weathering supplied {\textasciitilde}60 and 70\% of dissolved Li and Sr in fresh groundwaters, respectively, with the remainder provided by atmospheric input, and carbonate weathering; for major cations, the majority of calcium and sodium (Na) are supplied by carbonate weathering and atmospheric input, respectively. The estimated low proportion of Sr produced by carbonate weathering was surprising in a carbonate aquifer, and the 87Sr/86Sr data indicated that the silicate Sr source had low Rb/Sr and 87Sr/86Sr ratios. There was an increase in the maximum δ7Li values in fresh groundwaters (+36‰) relative to the maximum value in rainfall and seawater (ca. +31‰). As clay minerals are undersaturated in fresh groundwaters, this increase may be explained by Li isotope fractionation associated with ion-exchange reactions on clays and iron(oxy)hydroxides. In the more saline groundwaters, the minimum δ7Li values decreased with depth to +14.5‰, suggesting increased silicate mineral dissolution in the deeper aquifer. These results reveal the importance of water-rock interactions in a coastal carbonate aquifer, and demonstrate the usefulness of Li isotopes for tracing weathering reactions in an environmental setting where traditional weathering tracers, such as sodium and Sr isotopes, are less appropriate.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.apgeochem.2020.104698},
	abstract = {The hydrological relationship between surface waters and groundwaters in many regions of the world is well known and the effects of their mutual interaction and interaction with the soils and bedrocks, with respect to resulting changes in their chemical composition, are well studied. In this study we add to this knowledge by comparing the distributional patterns of strontium (Sr) isotopes in previously published 192 surface water samples with those of newly acquainted Sr isotope data from groundwater-based drinking water samples extracted from 163 of the major waterworks in Denmark. The aim is to investigate potential compositional changes that might derive from the interaction with the aquifer lithology or overlying sediments and soils. The average Sr isotope signatures of surface and groundwater-based drinking waters define 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.7096 ± 0.0015 (2σ) and 0.7088 ± 0.0013 (2σ), respectively. The skewed distribution of Sr isotope compositions in groundwaters towards lower 87Sr/86Sr values indicates enhanced contribution of natural carbonate-derived strontium with depth, while slightly elevated 87Sr/86Sr signatures in surface waters may reflect the diminished contribution of Sr from carbonates in the glaciogenic sediments due to their progressive acid dissolution. Strontium concentrations [Sr] in groundwater-based drinking water from the participating major waterworks define a country-wide average of 1.17 mg/L and the distributional pattern shows an East – West decreasing trend. Lowest concentrations are found in the West Jutland glaciogenic province (WJGP; average [Sr] = 0.36 mg/L) and in the northernmost tip of Jutland. A corresponding pattern, although less pronounced, is also depicted by the 87Sr/86Sr signatures of groundwater-based drinking water, whereby increasing 87Sr/86Sr values from Zealand through Funen into the Jutland peninsula correspond with increasing thickness of glaciogenic overburden providing (though mass-balance wise subordinate) radiogenic Sr to the natural carbonate-dominated groundwaters. The highest 87Sr/86Sr values are recorded in waters from northern Jutland, possibly reflecting the admixture of radiogenic strontium from late glacial and post-glacial glacio-isostatic adjustment-related marine aquifers. Generally, the surprisingly rather homogeneous and similar distributional patterns of 87Sr/86Sr signatures of Danish aquifers and surface waters implies a strong and dominant control of Sr by natural clastic (reworked) carbonate components in the Quaternary, Miocene and Holocene sediments, and to lesser degree (with the exception of northern central Jutland and Eastern Zealand) from the pre-Quaternary limestone dominated “basement” directly. Our results are consistent with a tight hydrological and geochemical interrelationship between surface waters and groundwaters in Denmark. There is a need for further investigations of the effects of advanced treatment of soft (acidic) groundwater-based drinking water on the concentrations and isotopic signatures of trace elements such as Sr. However, our study lends support for the adequate use of Sr isotope signatures of either of these waters to characterize the isotope compositional range of bioavailable fractions relevant for authenticity identification, forensic studies, and for prehistoric and modern human and animal proveniencing.},

	abstract = {The use of strontium isotopes in pre-historic mobility studies requires accurate isoscapes for evaluating whether pre-historic individuals are local to the areas in which they were buried or not. Isoscapes are often based on modern-day samples, commonly surface waters. There is, however, growing evidence that modern-day farming has a significant impact on the strontium isotopic composition of surface waters and farmed soils, mainly due to the use of agricultural lime for soil improvement. In this paper, we investigate the fate of strontium from agricultural lime in an experimentally-manipulated field in central Jutland, Denmark. Agricultural limestone was added to this field at very high rates in 2012 and 2013 to investigate CO2 storage in soils. Strontium was first measured from the site in 2014. In 2019 we reevaluated strontium concentrations and found that 80–100\% of the strontium from the agricultural lime had leached out of the organic-rich topsoil, and likely seeped into the underlying groundwater and nearby surface waters. In both the sandy soils of the liming test site and farmed soils and heathland in the adjacent area, Sr exhibits a degree of mobility similar to that of calcium, which is in agreement with data for other soil types and what is predicted by the size of its hydrated ions. Strontium isotopic compositions of unfarmed heathland samples show much higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios, and so are not influenced by carbonates, suggesting that the limestone 87Sr/86Sr signature seen in the farmland and in streams and rivers in contact with this comes from agricultural lime, and not from natural carbonate relicts occasionally found in the area. This suggests that the 87Sr/86Sr signatures of the area were higher in pre-historic times, and that an isoscape map based on samples from modern-day farmland is inappropriate for application to provenance and mobility studies of pre-historic people. Thus, it is critical that the possible impact of farming is evaluated when conducting provenance and mobility studies, especially in areas with Sr-poor soils and where agricultural lime is used for soil improvement. Overlooking this can result in significant overestimation of the degree of pre-historic mobility.},

The food of the caterpillars \{Betula pendula Roth (Fagales: Betulaceae) leaves\} was contaminated by dipping in the solution of MnCl2·4H2O with manganese concentrations of 0, 0.5, 5 and 10 mg ml−1, by which differentiated manganese contents (307; 632; 4,087 and 8,124 mg kg−1) were reached. Parameters recorded during the rearing were as follows: effect of manganese on food consumption, mortality and length of the development of caterpillars, pupation and hatching of imagoes. At the same time, manganese concentrations were determined in the offered and unconsumed food, excrements, and exuviae of the caterpillars, pupal cases and imagoes by using the AAS method. As compared with the control, high manganese contents in the food of gypsy moth caterpillars affected the process of development particularly by increased mortality of the first instar caterpillars (8 \% mortality for caterpillars with no Mn contamination (T0) and 62 \% mortality for subjects with the highest contamination by manganese (T3)), by prolonged development of the first–third instar (18.7 days (T0) and 27.8 days (T3)) and by increased food consumption of the first–third instar \{0.185 g of leaf dry matter (T0) and 0.483 g of leaf dry matter (T3)\}. The main defence strategy of the caterpillars to prevent contamination by the increased manganese content in food is the translocation of manganese into frass and exuviae castoff in the process of ecdysis. In the process of development, the content of manganese was reduced by excretion in imagoes to 0.5 \% of the intake level even at its maximum inputs in food.},

	abstract = {Roadside habitats are increasingly being targeted for restoration and conservation. Roadside habitats often exhibit altered soil and plant chemistry due to pollution from maintenance (e.g. de-icing salt), car deterioration, and exhaust. Roadside plants may attract animals due to elevated levels of sodium or nitrogen, but high concentrations of heavy metals and sodium can be toxic, potentially setting an ecological trap. In this study, we determine how roads influence the chemistry of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) as it is the primary roadside host plant for the declining monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) in the eastern United States. Even though road salt is applied during the winter, we detect enhanced sodium along roads the following growing season. Road salts increase soil sodium, which in turn elevates host-plant foliar sodium (occasionally to toxic levels in {\textless}10\% of plants) and sodium content in monarch caterpillars feeding on these plants. Sodium levels of milkweed leaves are highest close to the edge of busy roads. Some heavy metals (lead, zinc) are also elevated in roadside soils or plants. Nitrogen content was affected by adjacent agricultural use, but not traffic volume or proximity to a road. Other potential road pollutants (e.g. nickel) were not elevated in soil or plants. Despite a clear signature of road pollution in the chemistry of milkweed, most plants are likely still suitable for developing monarchs. Nonetheless, restoration investments in snowy regions should prioritize sites with lower-traffic density that are further from the road edge to minimize toxic impacts of high sodium. To extend this research to other insects of conservation concern, future work should characterize the nutritional quality of nectar, pollen, and other species of host-plants in roadside habitats.},

	abstract = {The adaptation of insects to environmental changes can constitute a crucial factor in their development and activity. The response of Cabera pusaria L. (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) caterpillars to high manganese (Mn) concentrations in the diet was studied. Birch leaves were treated by dipping in MnCl2·4H2O solutions, thereby achieving Mn contents of 370 (T0), 695 (T1), 3 198 (T2), and 6 302 mg kg−1 (T3). The reactions were determined by observing caterpillar mortality, development time, food consumption, and pupal weight. Manganese concentrations in larval excrement, pupae, and food were determined. Manganese in the diet at unnaturally increased concentrations caused great stress for caterpillars. All individuals in the treatment with the highest Mn concentration (T3) died during rearing and successful pupation occurred in only four individuals in T2. Even in the case of caterpillars from T1 (twofold higher than T0) a negative reaction (increased food consumption and prolonged development) was recorded. We also determined significantly increased Mn concentration in pupae from T1 (T2 and T3 were not included in this evaluation due to mortality) and excrement (T1‒T3) compared with T0 having a natural Mn concentration. Caterpillars were seen to eliminate negatively acting dietary Mn by its translocation to excrement. However, the highest mortality rate in T2 and T3 and negative reactions of individuals in T1 very likely demonstrate energy insufficiency and the high energy requirements of Mn elimination mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Rapid adaptation of insect species to environmental changes can be advantageous for their development. Forest cockchafer (Melolontha hippocastani) is herbivorous insect species with high food intake that has been widely studied within European conditions. It can cause huge economic and ecological losses especially in oak-dominated forest stands. Food preference of this species is mainly comprised of trees with a potential to accumulate manganese in their assimilation apparatus. In order to determine cockchafer's reactions to increased Mn concentration in its food, the adults were reared in laboratory conditions controlled for temperature, humidity, and light on a natural diet of oak (Quercus petraea) leaves. Food was contaminated by soaking in solutions of MnCl2·4H2O in concentrations from 0.5 to 10 mg ml−1. Food consumption, activity period of adults, quantity of eggs laid, body weights of individuals, as well as Mn concentrations in unconsumed food, excrement, and the bodies of cockchafers were determined to indicate how these change in reaction to food quality altered in terms of Mn content. The results showed that very high Mn content in the diet significantly influenced food consumption by M. hippocastani adults and thereby their development. This was in spite of the tendency of individuals to expel Mn through the faeces and incorporate it into undetermined parts of their bodies. Negative reactions of the experimental population were determined in treatments fed leaves with Mn concentration of 1800 ppm and more. Our experiment proved that Mn can greatly influence the phytophagous cockchafer (decreased feeding time, food consumption, and fertility).},

Agrochemical products and other classes of contaminants, such as trace elements and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, contribute to the general decline of bees’ populations.

We con-ducted a review of the existing literature regarding the type of effects evaluated in Apis mellifera, collecting information about regions, methodological approaches, the type of contaminants, and honey bees’ life stages. Europe and North America are the regions in which A. mellifera biological responses were mostly studied and the most investigated compounds are insecticides. A. mellifera was studied more in the laboratory than in field conditions. Through the observation of the different responses examined, we found that there were several knowledge gaps that should be addressed, particularly within enzymatic and molecular responses, such as those regarding the immune system and genotoxicity. The importance of developing an integrated approach that combines responses at different levels, from molecular to organism and population, needs to be highlighted in order to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic contamination on this pollinator species.},

MLC values (dry mass) for Co (45 μg/g), Ni (230 μg/g), and Zn (280 μg/g) were below published minimum hyperaccumulator levels. MSC levels (dry mass) for Co (15 μg/g), Ni (140 μg/g), and Zn (200 μg/g) were at concentrations lower than published minimum accumulator levels. Furthermore, both MLC and MSC values for Zn were within normal tissue concentrations.

	abstract = {For decades, people have reduced the transmission of pathogens by adding low-quality hosts to managed environments like agricultural fields. More recently, there has been interest in whether similar ‘dilution effects’ occur in natural disease systems, and whether these effects are eroded as diversity declines. For some pathogens of plants, humans and other animals, the highest-quality hosts persist when diversity is lost, so that high-quality hosts dominate low-diversity communities, resulting in greater pathogen transmission. Meta-analyses reveal that these natural dilution effects are common. However, studying them remains challenging due to limitations on the ability of researchers to manipulate many disease systems experimentally, difficulties of acquiring data on host quality and confusion about what should and should not be considered a dilution effect. Because dilution effects are widely used in managed disease systems and have been documented in a variety of natural disease systems, their existence should not be considered controversial. Important questions remain about how frequently they occur and under what conditions to expect them. There is also ongoing confusion about their relationships to both pathogen spillover and general biogeographical correlations between diversity and disease, which has resulted in an inconsistent and confusing literature. Progress will require rigorous and creative research.},

	abstract = {The Western Bean Cutworm (Striacosta albicosta, Smith), a significant agricultural pest, has a broad distribution in North America having recently expanded northeastward. However, while there are significant populations each summer in Ontario, Canada, this species has limited local overwintering capacity, which suggests a high proportion of immigrant moths. Knowing the origins of immigrant moths would provide insight into their migration and could assist in their management. We used stable-hydrogen isotope (δ2H) analyses of wings from 283 moths captured over a seven-year period (2012–2020) to estimate origins of these individuals based on the well-established precipitation isoscape for the continent. We also analysed wings for stable-carbon isotopes (δ13C) to examine host plant use as this species uses both C3 (e.g., beans) and C4 (e.g., corn) sources during larval development. Regardless of year, most moths (71\%–91\%) fed on corn as larvae. We combined this finding with δ2H analyses to narrow probable geographic natal origins by applying an informed prior to Bayesian-based isotopic assignments by assuming the Corn Belt of the United States as the likely region of origin. This combined approach indicated Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio as the most likely origins, a conclusion supported by analyses of wind trajectories on nights prior to high trap catches in our study area. While our combined approach narrowed down the possible origins of cutworms captured in southern Ontario, estimates of origin remain relatively broad and to be useful for management purposes future refinements will be required.},

Our analyses showed that Iberian populations are characterized by high gene flow, whereas the highly isolated Canarian populations have experienced strong genetic drift and loss of genetic diversity. Historical demographic reconstructions revealed that all populations have passed through a substantial genetic bottleneck around the last glacial maximum ({\textasciitilde}21 ka BP) followed by a sharp demographic expansion at the onset of the Holocene, indicating increased effective population sizes during warm periods as expected from the thermophilic nature of the species. Genome scans and environmental association analyses identified several loci putatively under selection, suggesting that local adaptation processes in certain populations might not be impeded by widespread gene flow. Finally, all analyses showed few differences between outbreak and nonoutbreak populations. Integrated pest management practices should consider high population connectivity and the potential importance of local adaptation processes on population persistence.},

To investigate the roles of interacting processes as drivers of population-level genetic diversity in the wild, we compared neutral and functional structure and diversity between 20 Tetrix undulata pygmy grasshopper populations in disturbed and stable habitats. Genetic differentiation was evident among the different populations, but there was no genetic separation between stable and disturbed environments. The incidence of long-winged phenotypes was higher in disturbed habitats, indicating that these populations were recently established by flight-capable colonizers. Color morph diversity and dispersion of outlier genetic diversity, estimated using AFLP markers, were higher in disturbed than in stable environments, likely reflecting that color polymorphism and variation in other functionally important traits increase establishment success. Neutral genetic diversity estimated using AFLP markers was lower in disturbed habitats, indicating stronger eroding effects on neutral diversity of genetic drift associated with founding events in disturbed compared to stable habitats. Functional diversity and neutral diversity were negatively correlated across populations, highlighting the utility of outlier loci in genetics studies and reinforcing that estimates of genetic diversity based on neutral markers do not infer evolutionary potential and the ability of populations and species to cope with environmental change.},

Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom. We hope that the following chapters demonstrate the spectacular results that can be achieved when performing the relatively simple experiment of focusing a beam of electrons down to an atomic scale and measuring the scattering that results.

Using RAD sequencing we identified a total of 9365 SNPs in 150 individuals collected across the species' entire distribution range. Relying on assumption-free genetic clustering methods and environmental association tests we then compared neutral with adaptive genetic structure. We found three neutral and six adaptive genetic clusters, which could be considered management units (MU) and adaptive units (AU), respectively. Pairwise genetic differentiation (FST) ranged between 0.024 and 0.048, and even though effective population sizes were below 100, no significant inbreeding was found in any inferred cluster. Nearly 10 \% of all analysed sequences contained loci associated with temperature and precipitation, from which only 25 sequences contained annotated proteins, with some of them being very relevant for physiological processes in plants.

In this context, recently diverged taxa represent a unique opportunity to study the process of genetic differentiation. Northern and southern Idaho ground squirrels (Urocitellus brunneus—NIDGS, and U. endemicus—SIDGS, respectively) are a recently diverged pair of sister species that have undergone dramatic declines in the last 50 years and are currently found in metapopulations across restricted spatial areas with distinct environmental pressures. Here we genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from buccal swabs with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq). With these data we evaluated neutral genetic structure at both the inter- and intraspecific level, and identified putatively adaptive SNPs using population structure outlier detection and genotype–environment association (GEA) analyses. At the interspecific level, we detected a clear separation between NIDGS and SIDGS, and evidence for adaptive differentiation putatively linked to torpor patterns. At the intraspecific level, we found evidence of both neutral and adaptive differentiation. For NIDGS, elevation appears to be the main driver of adaptive differentiation, while neutral variation patterns match and expand information on the low connectivity between some populations identified in previous studies using microsatellite markers. For SIDGS, neutral substructure generally reflected natural geographical barriers, while adaptive variation reflected differences in land cover and temperature, as well as elevation. These results clearly highlight the roles of neutral and adaptive processes for understanding the complexity of the processes leading to species and population differentiation, which can have important conservation implications in susceptible and threatened species.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10980-005-5245-9},
	abstract = {Genetic diversity is important for the maintenance of the viability and the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations and species. However, there are two principal types of genetic diversity: adaptive and neutral - a fact widely neglected by non-specialists. We introduce these two types of genetic diversity and critically point to their potential uses and misuses in population or landscape genetic studies. First, most molecular-genetic laboratory techniques analyse neutral genetic variation. This means that the gene variants detected do not have any direct effect on fitness. This type of genetic variation is thus selectively neutral and tells us nothing about the adaptive or evolutionary potential of a population or a species. Nevertheless, neutral genetic markers have great potential for investigating processes such as gene flow, migration or dispersal. Hence, they allow us to empirically test the functional relevance of spatial indices such as connectivity used in landscape ecology. Second, adaptive genetic variation, i.e. genetic variation under natural selection, is analysed in quantitative genetic experiments under controlled and uniform environmental conditions. Unfortunately, the genetic variation (i.e. heritability) and population differentiation at quantitative, adaptive traits is not directly linked with neutral genetic diversity or differentiation. Thus, neutral genetic data cannot serve as a surrogate of adaptive genetic data. In summary, neutral genetic diversity is well suited for the study of processes within landscapes such as gene flow, while the evolutionary or adaptive potential of populations or species has to be assessed in quantitative genetic experiments. Landscape ecologists have to mind these differences between neutral and adaptive genetic variation when interpreting the results of landscape genetic studies. © Springer 2006.},

Monarchs migrating through Florida-Cuba do not overwinter and are mostly found nectaring and flying close to vegetation. This present study explores whether Florida-Cuba versus Mexican migrants differ in (1) phenotypic traits important for migration (e.g. wing size and condition, lipid and lean mass content, and reproductive status) and (2) migratory strategies. The monarch natal grounds (e.g. migrants versus residents) were determined through thin-layer chromatography cardenolide fingerprint and stable isotopes (hydrogen δ2H and carbon δ13C). In addition, wing size and condition, lipid and lean mass, and reproductive status were determined. The results suggest that Mexican migrants are better suited for longer sustained flights and successful overwinter periods as a result of larger wings in better condition, reproductive diapause, and significant fat content. By contrast, Florida-Cuba migrants are more suited for shorter flights and opportunistic migratory strategies, given that their wings were in poor condition, as well as the active reproductive status of {\textgreater}50\% of these butterflies and their significantly low fat content. Eastern monarch migration is more complex and diverse than previously assumed. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.},

	abstract = {Information obtained from the analysis of dust, particularly biological particles such as pollen, plant parts, and fungal spores, has great utility in forensic geolocation. As an alternative to manual microscopic analysis of dust components, we developed a pipeline that utilizes the airborne plant environmental DNA (eDNA) in settled dust to estimate geographic origin. Metabarcoding of settled airborne eDNA was used to identify plant species whose geographic distributions were then derived from occurrence records in the USGS Biodiversity in Service of Our Nation (BISON) database. The distributions for all plant species identified in a sample were used to generate a probabilistic estimate of the sample source. With settled dust collected at four U.S. sites over a 15-month period, we demonstrated positive regional geolocation (within 600 km2 of the collection point) with 47.6\% (20 of 42) of the samples analyzed. Attribution accuracy and resolution was dependent on the number of plant species identified in a dust sample, which was greatly affected by the season of collection. In dust samples that yielded a minimum of 20 identified plant species, positive regional attribution was achieved with 66.7\% (16 of 24 samples). For broader demonstration, citizen-collected dust samples collected from 31 diverse U.S. sites were analyzed, and trace plant eDNA provided relevant regional attribution information on provenance in 32.2\% of samples. This showed that analysis of airborne plant eDNA in settled dust can provide an accurate estimate regional provenance within the U.S., and relevant forensic information, for a substantial fraction of samples analyzed.},

	abstract = {Geochemical inferences on ancient diet using bone and enamel apatite rely mainly on carbon isotope ratios (δ13C) and to a lesser extent on strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca) and barium/calcium (Ba/Ca) elemental ratios. Recent developments in nontraditional stable isotopes provide an unprecedented opportunity to use additional paleodietary proxies to disentangle complex diets such as omnivory. Of particular relevance for paleodietary reconstruction are metals present in large quantity in bone and enamel apatite, providing that biologically mediated fractionation processes are constrained. Calcium isotope ratios (δ44Ca) meet these criteria but exhibit complex ecological patterning. Stable magnesium isotope ratios (δ26Mg) also meet these criteria but a comprehensive understanding of its variability awaits new isotopic data. Here, 11 extant mammal species of known ecology from a single locality in equatorial Africa were sampled for tooth enamel and, together with vegetation and feces, analyzed for δ26Mg, δ13C, Sr/Ca, and Ba/Ca ratios. The results demonstrate that δ26Mg incorporated in tooth enamel becomes heavier from strict herbivores to omnivores/ faunivores. Using data from experimentally raised sheep, we suggest that this 26Mg enrichment up the trophic chain is due to a 26Mg enrichment in muscle relative to bone. Notably, it is possible to distinguish omnivores from herbivores, using δ26Mg coupled to Ba/Ca ratios. The potential effects of metabolic and dietary changes on the enamel δ26Mg composition remain to be explored but, in the future, multiproxy approaches would permit a substantial refinement of dietary behaviors or enable accurate trophic reconstruction despite specimen-limited sampling, as is often the case for fossil assemblages.},

Additionally, we report the size-mediated nutritional concentrations of 2 Orthoptera families: Acrididae and Tettigoniidae. Crude fat concentrations were 56\%, 63\%, and 53\% higher in small, medium, and large Tettigoniidae than in Acrididae, respectively. Crude protein concentration varied minimally among arthropod groups (range 60.32\%-76.00\%), while caloric densities (gross energy) were similar among the majority of arthropod groups that were analyzed (range 16.54-23.36 kJ/g). In addition, small (early instar) orthropterans peaked synchronous to the mean first clutch hatch date for 2 species of grassland birds at the study site. Our results suggest that size and insect taxonomy influence crude fat and protein concentrations but do not appear to influence gross energy concentrations. Peak fat and protein concentration occurred during the early nestling phase for both avian species, implying synchrony between food availability and the nestling provisioning period for grassland nesting birds.},

The small sample size of this study precluded statistical analyses, however comparatively, CP in adult B. lateralis and B. dubia was greater than the CP in nymphs of the same species.

Inversely, fat content in adult B. lateralis and B. dubia was lower than that of nymphs of the same species. All adults contained similar levels of ADF, yet adult B. giganteus had greater ADF than nymphs; conversely, B. lateralis and B. dubia adults had less ADF than nymphs. There were differences noted in mineral parameters among the four species and life stages. Adult B. giganteus had less Ca than G. portentosa, and the lowest Ca content of the four species of nymphs and adults analyzed.

	abstract = {In many migratory insects, migration occurs during the prereproductive phase of the life cycle. This trait probably arises from a trade-off between migration and reproduction and in females has been termed the ‘oogenesis–flight syndrome’. However, the generality of this syndrome has been questioned, especially for monomorphic insects. We studied the relationship between migration and reproduction in the highly cosmopolitan painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, which in the Palaearctic undertakes the longest known multigenerational migration circuit of any insect. We tested for the oogenesis–flight syndrome in both spring and autumn migrants in two regions linked by migration, North Africa and northern Spain. Field observations were combined with laboratory experiments to determine the life span and the age at first mating to unravel the reproductive strategy observed in wild-caught individuals. Females and males wait on average around 5–6 days before mating, and field data revealed that mating frequencies increased rapidly once females reached a medium wing wear category. There were seasonal differences in mating frequencies in the study regions depending on whether the region acted as a source or as a destination for migrants, and in the latter case there were almost twice as many mated females. Moreover, a great majority of females collected during migratory flights were unmated, the remaining females having mated only very recently. Our results thus strongly indicate that the painted lady fulfils the oogenesis–flight syndrome, as migration is concentrated in its relatively short prereproductive period. Field data also showed a high positive correlation between mating frequency and host plant abundance, which suggests that mated females are able to locate potential breeding areas. This, together with the high fecundity estimated in laboratory trials, makes the painted lady a highly successful migratory insect.},

	abstract = {Background: North American monarchs (Danaus plexippus) are well-known for their long-distance migrations; however, some monarchs within the migratory range have adopted a resident lifestyle and breed year-round at sites where tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica) is planted in the southern coastal United States. An important question is whether exposure to exotic milkweed alters monarch migratory physiology, particularly the ability to enter and remain in the hormonally-induced state of reproductive diapause, whereby adults delay reproductive maturity. Cued by cooler temperatures and shorter photoperiods, diapause is a component of the monarch’s migratory syndrome that includes directional flight behavior, lipid accumulation, and the exceptional longevity of the migratory generation. Methods: Here, we experimentally test how exposure to tropical milkweed during the larval and adult stages influences monarch reproductive status during fall migration. Caterpillars reared under fall-like conditions were fed tropical versus native milkweed diets, and wild adult migrants were placed in outdoor flight cages with tropical milkweed, native milkweed, or no milkweed. Results: We found that monarchs exposed to tropical milkweed as larvae were more likely to be reproductively active (exhibit mating behavior in males and develop mature eggs in females) compared to monarchs exposed to native milkweed. Among wild-caught fall migrants, females exposed to tropical milkweed showed greater egg development than females exposed to native or no milkweed, although a similar response was not observed for males. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence that exposure to tropical milkweed can increase monarch reproductive activity, which could promote continued residency at year-round breeding sites and decrease monarch migratory propensity.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen isotopes (δ2H) are often used to infer the origins of migratory animals based on the strong correlation between deuterium content of tissues and long-term patterns of precipitation. However, the extreme flood and drought dynamics of surface waters in prairie wetland systems could mask these expected correlations. We investigated H isotopic variability in an aquatic food web associated with Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) that rely heavily on wetland-derived aerial insects for food. We evaluated isotopic turnover and incorporation of environmental water into tissue, processes that could affect H isotopic composition. Wetland water and aquatic invertebrates showed intra- and interannual H isotopic variation mainly related to evaporation and the amount and timing of precipitation. Snails showed rapid turnover of tissue deuterium and a large contribution of environmental water to their tissues. Swallow feather deuterium (δ2Hf) was variable but did not clearly follow changes in any of the food web compartments measured. Instead, isotopic variability may have been driven by shifts in the type or relative amounts of prey consumed and types of wetlands used. Nevertheless, despite relatively high variance in δ2H f, the majority of birds fell within the predicted range of δ2Hf for the study area, revealing that significant trophic averaging occurred. However, both (presumed) diet shifts and variable hydrological conditions have the potential to greatly increase variance that must be considered when assigning origins of migratory animals based on δ2H. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Using ground beetles as model organisms, we tested our pollution intensity-dependent disposal hypothesis for five pollutants (Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn) among four soil pollution intensity levels (low, moderate, high, and extreme) by categorical meta-analysis on published data. According to our hypothesis, decontamination and excretion of pollutants in ground beetles are effective in lowly or moderately polluted habitats, while disposal is ineffective in highly or extremely polluted ones, contributing to intense accumulation of pollutants in ground beetles. In accordance with the hypothesis, we found that in an extremely polluted habitat, accumulation of Cd and Pb in ground beetles was significantly higher than in lowly polluted ones. These findings may suggest the entomoremediation potential of ground beetles in an extremely polluted environment.},

	abstract = {Concepts and developments for a new field in ecotoxicology, referred to as "landscape ecotoxicology," were proposed in the 1990s; however, to date, few studies have been developed in this emergent field. In fact, there is a strong interest in developing this area, both for renewing the concepts and tools used in ecotoxicology as well as for responding to practical issues, such as risk assessment. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial heterogeneity of metal bioaccumulation in animals in order to identify the role of spatially explicit factors, such as landscape as well as total and extractable metal concentrations in soils. Over a smelter-impacted area, we studied the accumulation of trace metals (TMs: Cd, Pb and Zn) in invertebrates (the grove snail Cepaea sp and the glass snail Oxychilus draparnaudi) and vertebrates (the bank vole Myodes glareolus and the greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula). Total and CaCl2-extractable concentrations of TMs were measured in soils from woody patches where the animals were captured. TM concentrations in animals exhibited a high spatial heterogeneity. They increased with soil pollution and were better explained by total rather than CaCl2-extractable TM concentrations, except in Cepaea sp. TM levels in animals and their variations along the pollution gradient were modulated by the landscape, and this influence was species and metal specific. Median soil metal concentrations (predicted by universal kriging) were calculated in buffers of increasing size and were related to bioaccumulation. The spatial scale at which TM concentrations in animals and soils showed the strongest correlations varied between metals, species and landscapes. The potential underlying mechanisms of landscape influence (community functioning, behaviour, etc.) are discussed. Present results highlight the need for the further development of landscape ecotoxicology and multi-scale approaches, which would enhance our understanding of pollutant transfer and effects in ecosystems. © 2011 Fritsch et al.},

Different metals have different roles in biology and can be classified as essential if they are required by a living organism (e.g., as cofactors), or as non-essential metals if they are not. While essential metal ions have been well studied in many eukaryotic species, less is known about the effects of non-essential metals, even though essential and non-essential metals are often chemically similar and can bind to the same biological ligands. Insects are often exposed to a variety of contaminated environments and associated essential and non-essential metal toxicity, but many questions regarding their response to toxicity remain unanswered. Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent insect model species in which to study the effects of toxic metal due to the extensive experimental and genetic resources available for this species. Here, we review the current understanding of the impact of a suite of essential and non-essential metals (Cu, Fe, Zn, Hg, Pb, Cd, and Ni) on the D. melanogaster metal response system, highlighting the knowledge gaps between essential and non-essential metals in D. melanogaster. This review emphasizes the need to use multiple metals, multiple genetic backgrounds, and both sexes in future studies to help guide future research towards better understanding the effects of metal contamination in general.},

	abstract = {1. Dispersal and host-foraging activity are important behavioural characteristics for parasitoid species used as biological control agents. Appropriate marking techniques are often needed for field investigations into these behaviours because of the small size of parasitoids. This study developed a novel technique using the rare stable calcium isotope 44Ca to mark parasitoids. 2. As demonstrated with a tri-trophic model system consisting of cabbage plant Brassica oleracea, caterpillar Pieris brassicae and gregarious parasitoid Cotesia glomerata, marking parasitoids with the isotope 44Ca is systemic and non-disruptive. Significant uptake and translocation of 44Ca occurred in cabbage plants after being drenched with 50 mMol aqueous isotope solution, and the isotope was transferred to wasps emerging from the parasitized host caterpillars that fed on the isotope-enriched plant. The isotope enrichment did not adversely influence the survivorship of hosts or the development of parasitoids. 3. The 44Ca-enriched female wasps could pass the isotope marker further via oviposition into the parasitized host caterpillars, hence allowing the marker to be transferred across parasitoid generations. Greenhouse release experiments validated the transferability of 44Ca from the enriched wasps to hosts through parasitism. The 95\% upper confidence limit for the mean 44Ca/40Ca isotope ratio in the hosts without 44Ca enrichment (control) could be used as a statistical marking criterion to identify reliably the individual parasitized hosts within the first 3 days of parasitism. 4. Synthesis and applications. We have, for the first time, documented the efficient transfer of a stable isotope marker from enriched parasitoids to host insects through parasitism. This isotope technique enables the study of dispersal and host-foraging activity of parasitoids in the field without having to recapture marked individual parasitoids. Information on the dispersal pattern and host-foraging activity of the parasitoid species concerned is obtained from the spatial distribution of the parasitized marked host insects. Furthermore, this isotope technique can be used to quantify the efficacy of parasitism by the parasitoids released in the field. © 2006 The Authors.},

In this article, we first review the rationale behind the cycling of Ca isotopes in vertebrate organisms. We then summarize and discuss the use of Ca isotopes as dietary tracers from trophic reconstructions in past vertebrate ecosystems to the tracking of early life dietary transitions. Next, we review and examine the research outcomes on the potential of Ca isotopes as biomarkers of bone loss in physiological and pathological conditions such as bone cancers and osteoporosis. While emphasizing the needs of future research in each of these applications, we suggest new potential uses of Ca isotopes in vertebrate biology.

	abstract = {Non-traditional stable isotopes of metals were recently shown as new dietary tracers in terrestrial and marine mammals. Whether these metal stable isotopes can be used to understand feeding habits in stream food webs is not known yet. In this study, we explored the potential of stable isotopes of essential Mg (δ26Mg) and Zn (δ66Zn) as a new tool in stream ecology. For this purpose, we determined δ26Mg and δ66Zn values of stream organisms and their potential metal sources in upper and lower reaches of two streams in the Lake Biwa catchment, Central Japan. Our goals were (1) to explore variations in δ26Mg and δ66Zn across organisms of different feeding habits and (2) to understand Mg and Zn sources to stream organisms. Overall, δ26Mg and δ66Zn values of organisms were neither related to each other, nor to δ13C and δ15N values, indicating different elemental sources and factors controlling isotopic fractionation depending on element and taxa. Low δ26Mg values in filter-feeding caddisfly larvae and small gobies indicated aqueous Mg uptake. Higher δ26Mg values in leaf-shredding crane fly and grazing mayfly larvae suggested Mg isotopic fractionation during Mg uptake from the diet. While the δ26Mg values of stonefly nymphs reflected those of caddisfly larvae as a potential prey, the highest δ26Mg values found in dobsonfly nymphs can be explained by 26Mg enrichment during maturing. δ66Zn values of caddisfly and mayfly larvae indicated Zn was a mixture of aqueous and dietary available Zn, while higher δ66Zn values in crane fly larvae pointed to Zn isotopic fractionation during Zn uptake from plant litter. δ66Zn values in stonefly and dobsonfly nymphs were often in the range of those of caddisfly larvae as their prey, while dragonfly nymphs and small goby were depleted in 66Zn relative to their dietary Zn sources. We conclude that δ26Mg is a promising indicator to assess Mg sources in stream ecology depending on taxa, while the use of δ66Zn is limited due to the complexity in Zn sources.},

Here we present ab initio calculations for the isotopic fractionation between various aqueous species of Ca and show that this fractionation can be up to 3000 ppm. We show that the Ca isotopic fractionation between soil solutions and plant roots can be explained by the difference of isotopic fractionation between the different first shell hydration degree of Ca 2+ and that the isotopic fractionation between roots and leaves is controlled by the precipitation of Ca-oxalates. The isotopic fractionation between blood and urine is due to the complexation of heavy Ca with citrate and oxalates in urine.

Ca and Mg isotopes allow, for their part, to identify plant-mineral interactions and recycling by vegetation. At the scale of monolithological silicate watersheds, Li and B isotope fractionations are mainly controlled by the degree of mineral leaching and the amount of clay mineral formation. Ca and Mg isotope signatures in soil and waters vary seasonally, depending on the vegetation growth cycle and rain events. In mixed-lithology basins, B and Li isotopes are controlled by alteration rates of silicate minerals and the residence time of waters within the watershed.

In this pilot study, we measured the 65Cu/63Cu ratios in the serums of 20 breast and 8 colorectal cancer patients, which correspond to, respectively, 90 and 49 samples taken at different times with molecular biomarker documentation. Copper isotope compositions were determined by multiple-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). When compared with the literature data from a control group of 50 healthy blood donors, abundances of Cu isotopes predict mortality in the colorectal cancer group with a probability p = 0.018. For the breast cancer patients and the group of control women the probability goes down to p = 0.0006 and the AUC under the ROC curve is 0.75. Most patients considered in this preliminary study and with serum δ65Cu lower than the threshold value of -0.35\% (per mil) did not survive. As a marker, a drop in δ65Cu precedes molecular biomarkers by several months. The observed decrease of δ65Cu in the serum of cancer patients is assigned to the extensive oxidative chelation of copper by cytosolic lactate. The potential of Cu isotope variability as a new diagnostic tool for breast and colorectal cancer seems strong. Shifts in Cu isotope compositions fingerprint cytosolic Cu chelation by lactate mono- and bidentates. This simple scheme provides a straightforward explanation for isotopically light Cu in the serum and isotopically heavy Cu in cancer cells: Cu+ escaping chelation by lactate and excreted into the blood stream is isotopically light. Low δ65Cu values in serum therefore reveal the strength of lactate production by the Warburg effect.},

Discussions were carried out with respect to age, sex, organ, and the presence or absence of particular diseases for animals and humans. For Fe and Cu isotopes, changes in oxidation states generate large isotopic fractionation through the metabolism of those elements. Isotope composition of Zn greatly fractionates among tissues even without changes in oxidation state. Isotopic composition of Ca is a powerful tracer for the metabolism of Ca in bones. The review results suggest that the stable isotope compositions of the biometals can be used as effective markers for diagnostics of various kinds of diseases related to metabolic disorders.},

Ultimately, Mg in streams is derived from the chemical weathering of bedrock in the catchment. In this study, we used Mg stable isotope ratios (δ26Mg) to test whether stream organisms reflect lithological sources in stream catchments. In November 2017 and May 2018, we sampled aquatic insects and small gobies from six temperate streams in the Lake Biwa area (central Japan). Three of these streams had up to 38\% limestone in their catchment (limestone streams), and three streams lacked limestone (non-limestone streams). We hypothesised that stream organisms from limestone streams had significantly lower δ26Mg values compared to those of the same organisms from non-limestone streams. Aquatic insects from limestone streams had an average of 0.78‰ lower δ26Mg values than those of the same organisms from non-limestone streams, thereby indicating a lithological control on the δ26Mg of aquatic insects. Aquatic insects often showed an offset to higher δ26Mg values compared to those of stream water, thereby pointing to a 26Mg-enriched diet as an additional Mg source to water and/or Mg isotope fractionation during Mg accumulation. Instead, stream water was the main Mg source for small gobies, as their bones reflected the δ26Mg of water. We concluded that δ26Mg could trace Mg sources of aquatic organisms, and the same methodology can be applied to other metals.},

This isotope marker is transferred from the parasitoid to host caterpillars through oviposition, and tracking of the marked wasps in the field was feasible in the presence of a native population by analyzing the sedentary host caterpillars. Data from two field trials with two trial areas each consistently showed that the parasitoid females dispersed over the entire cabbage field patches within 3 days and that the caterpillars parasitized by the released wasps were randomly distributed in space. Parasitism rates in sectors with and without flowering dill plants at the edges were not significantly different.

This uptake process is reported to have the unintended consequence of potentially toxic heavy metal (Cd, Zn) uptake in a variety of aquatic species. However, calcium uptake remains poorly understood in aquatic insects, the dominant invertebrate faunal group in most freshwater ecosystems. Here, we examined Ca uptake and interactions with heavy metals (Cd, Zn) at low ambient Ca levels (12.5 umol l"1) in 12 aquatic insect species within Ephemerellidae (mayfly) and Hydropsychidae (caddisfly), two families differentially responsive to trace metal pollution. We found Ca uptake varied 70-fold across the 12 species studied. Body mass and clade (family) were found to significantly influence both Ca uptake and adsorption (P≤0.05). Zn and Cd uptake rate constants (ku) exhibited a strong correlation (r=0.96, P{\textless}0.0001), suggesting a shared transport system. Ca uptake failed to significantly correlate with either Zn or Cd ku values. Further, neither Zn nor Cd exhibited inhibitory effects toward Ca uptake. In fact, we saw evidence of modest stimulation of Ca uptake rates in some metal treatments. This work suggests that insects generally differ from other freshwater taxa in that aqueous Ca uptake does not appear to be compromised by Cd or Zn exposure. It is important to understand the trace metal and major ion physiology of aquatic insects because of their ecological importance and widespread use as ecological indicators.},

AEs of Se and Zn remained constant among the 3 body sizes. AEs of Cd decreased with increasing body size, whereas AEs of Co increased with body size. The rate constant of metal uptake from the dissolved phase decreased with increasing body size, but the calculated metal absorption efficiencies remained relatively constant or increased slightly in larger mussels. Efflux rate constants were comparable among the 3 body sizes, except for Cd which was lost about 2 times faster in the smaller mussels than in the largest mussels. A bioenergetic-based kinetic model was used to calculate the allometric coefficient (b) of metal accumulation with mussel body size; predicted b values were comparable to field measurements. However, b increased exponentially with the growth rate constant, indicating that no single b value is likely to be observed in nature for a specific metal. The growth rate constant is needed for the model to predict metal concentration and allometry of metal accumulation in mussels, especially for smaller mussels. The relative importance of trace element uptake from the dissolved phase versus particulate ingestion in the overall metal uptake in mussels was relatively independent of mussel body size, primarily because the influx rates from the dissolved phase and from food were comparably related to body size.},

However, some insects feeding on metal hyperaccumulating plants are adapted to the high level of metals in plant tissues. Former studies on species that feed on the leaves of Berkheya coddii Roessler 1958 (Asteraceae), a nickel-hyperaccumulating plant, demonstrated several protective mechanisms involved in internal distribution, immobilization, and elimination of Ni from the midgut and Malpighian tubules. These species are mainly coleopterans, including the lady beetle, Epilachna nylanderi (Mulsant 1850) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), collected from the ultramafic ecosystem near Barberton in South Africa. By performing particle-induced X-ray emission microanalysis elemental microanalysis (PIXE), this study examined whether Ni may be harmful to internal body systems that decide on insect reactivity (central nervous system [CNS]), their reproduction, and the relationships between Ni and other micronutrients. Data on elemental distribution of nine selected elements in target organs of E. nylanderi were compared with the existing data for other insect species adapted to the excess of metals. Micro-PIXE maps of seven regions of the CNS showed Ni mainly in the neural connectives, while cerebral ganglia were better protected. Concentrations of other bivalent metals were lower than those of Ni. Testis, compared with other reproductive organs, showed low amounts of Ni. Zn was effectively regulated at physiological dietary levels. In insects exposed to excess dietary Zn, it was also accumulated in the reproductive organs. Comparison of E. nylanderii with other insects that ingest hyperaccumulating plants, especially chrysomelid Chrysolina clathrata (Clark) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), showed lower protection of the CNS and reproductive organs.},

Our data revealed a fiber-like structure of the hairs and confirmed the presence of voids close to its base connecting the hairs to the damselfly wings.

In this study, we tested whether similar Ca and Sr isotopic fractionation trends existed in macroinvertebrate-dominated stream food webs compared to vertebrates despite their physiological differences. We have determined the δ44/40Ca and δ88/86Sr values as well as the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of stream macroinvertebrates and small gobies and their potential metal sources (stream water, periphyton, and terrestrial plant litter) in upper and lower reaches of two streams in the Lake Biwa catchment, central Japan. The 87Sr/86Sr ratios revealed that stonefly nymphs, crustacea, and gobies mostly relied on aquatic Sr sources. Higher 87Sr/86Sr ratios of some crane fly and caddisfly larvae, mayfly, dobsonfly, and dragonfly nymphs indicated greater terrestrial contributions via plant litter. Positive correlations between the δ44/40Ca and δ88/86Sr values implied that similar Ca and Sr sources existed, and that Ca and Sr stable isotopes underwent similar fractionation trends although Sr was not essential. The δ44/40Ca and partly the δ88/86Sr values were positively correlated with Sr/Ca ratios and negatively with δ15N values indicating trophic effects on Ca and Sr stable isotopes. The enrichment of 44Ca and 88Sr in large filter-feeding caddisfly larvae was a notable exception from these trophic trends. Our data confirm that the trophic 44Ca and 88Sr depletion observed for marine teleost fishes and terrestrial vertebrates also applied to macroinvertebrate-dominated stream food webs despite their different physiologies indicating that shared mechanisms of Ca and Sr isotopic fractionation may exist at the cellular or molecular level between these taxa.},

Thus, feather isotope analysis, combined with knowledge of local isoscapes can be used to infer endogenous nutrient composition to feathers in cases where birds travel to moult. We investigated this possibility in a study of flightless moulting greylag geese Anser anser on the Danish island of Saltholm, which are known to mobilise endogenous protein stores (acquired at previous terrestrial staging locations in Sweden) to reconstitute muscle blocks and organs whilst feeding on a saltmarsh (i.e. marine-influenced) diet with contrasting stable isotope ratios. We used stable isotope (δ13C, δ15N) measurements to test the prediction that new-grown flight feathers would have stable isotope values intermediate between those derived from a purely terrestrial C3 diet and one composed purely of saltmarsh plants. Feather δ13C and δ15N values were intermediate between those expected for feather material derived from local saltmarsh (i.e. exogenous) food items and Swedish terrestrial (endogenous muscle) sources, suggesting a mixing of endogenous and exogenous sources. These results confirm that moult migrant Anatidae exploit body stores to meet specific protein needs during the flightless period of remige regrowth and caution against the use of feather stable isotope ratios as direct indicators of the isotopic environment in which they were regrown, where endogenous contributions may occur. © 2009 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Studies of animal movement and migration over large geospatial scales have long relied on natural continental-scale hydrogen isotope (δ2H) gradients in precipitation, yet the physiological processes that govern incorporation of δ2H from precipitation into plant and then herbivore tissues remain poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Establishing a biochemical framework for the propagation of δ2H through food webs would enable us to resolve more complicated regional-scale animal movements and potentially unlock new applications for δ2H data in animal ecology and eco-physiology. Amino acid δ2H analysis offers a promising new avenue by which to establish this framework. We report bulk tissue δ2H, δ13C, and δ15N data as well as amino acid δ2H and δ13C data from three Pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) tissues—caterpillars, butterfly bodies, and wings—as well as their obligate plant source: pipevine leaves (Aristolochia macrophylla). Insects are often dominant herbivores in terrestrial food webs and a major food source for many higher-level consumers, so it is particularly important to understand the mechanisms that influence insect tissue δ2H values. Our data reveal extensive δ2H variation within and among individuals of a relatively simple plant-herbivore system that cannot be explained by temporal or geospatial gradients of precipitation δ2H or dietary differences. Variations in essential amino acid δ2H and δ13C indicate that B. philenor acquire these compounds from an additional source that is isotopically distinct from pipevine leaves, potentially gut microbes. We also found multiple isotopic carryover effects associated with metamorphosis. This study emphasizes the strong influence of physiology on consumer-diet δ2H discrimination in a local population of pipevines and swallowtails and provides a template that can be broadly applied to Lepidoptera—the second most diverse insect order—and other holometabolous insects. Understanding these physiological mechanisms is critical to interpreting the large degree of δ2H variation in consumer tissues often observed at a single collection site, which has implications for using δ2H isoscapes to study animal movement. Further investigation into amino acid δ2H holds promise to elucidate how subsets of amino acids may be best utilized to address specific ecological and physiological questions for which bulk tissue δ2H is insufficient.},

We identified the environmental drivers of the annual population dynamics of a cosmopolitan migrant butterfly (the painted lady Vanessa cardui) using a combination of long-term monitoring and climate and atmospheric data within the western part of its Afro- Palearctic migratory range. Our population models show that a combination of high winter NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) in the Savanna/Sahel of sub-Saharan Africa, high spring NDVI in the Maghreb of North Africa, and frequent favorably directed tailwinds during migration periods are the three most important drivers of the size of the immigration to western Europe, while our atmospheric trajectory simulations demonstrate regular opportunities for wind-borne trans-Saharan movements. The effects of sub-Saharan vegetative productivity and wind conditions confirm that painted lady populations on either side of the Sahara are linked by regular mass migrations, making this the longest annual insect migration circuit so far known. Our results provide a quantification of the environmental drivers of large annual population fluctuations of an insect migrant and hold much promise for predicting invasions of migrant insect pests, disease vectors, and beneficial species.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models (SDMs) are widely used in ecology. In theory, SDMs capture (at least part of) species' ecological niches and can be used to make inferences about the distribution of suitable habitat for species of interest. Because habitat suitability is expected to influence population demography, SDMs have been used to estimate a variety of population parameters, from occurrence to genetic diversity. However, a critical look at the ability of SDMs to predict independent data across different aspects of population biology is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature, retrieving 201 studies that tested predictions from SDMs against independent assessments of occurrence, abundance, population performance, and genetic diversity. Although there is some support for the ability of SDMs to predict occurrence ({\textasciitilde}53\% of studies depending on how support was assessed), the predictive performance of these models declines progressively from occurrence to abundance, to population mean fitness, to genetic diversity. At the same time, we observed higher success among studies that evaluated performance for single versus multiple species, pointing to a possible publication bias. Thus, the limited accuracy of SDMs reported here may reflect the best-case scenario. We discuss the limitations of these models and provide specific recommendations for their use for different applications going forward. However, we emphasize that predictions from SDMs, especially when used to inform conservation decisions, should be treated as hypotheses to be tested with independent data rather than as stand-ins for the population parameters we seek to know.},

	abstract = {Spatial models of variation in the isotopic composition of structural nutrients across habitats (isoscapes) offer information on physical, biogeochemical and anthropogenic processes occurring across space, and provide a tool for retrospective assignment of animals or animal products to their foraging area or geographic origin. The isotopic differences among reference samples used to construct isoscapes may vary spatially and according to non-spatial terms (e.g. sampling date, or among individual or species effects). Partitioning variance between spatially dependent and spatially independent terms is a critical but overlooked aspect of isoscape creation with important consequences for the design of studies collecting reference data for isoscape creation and the accuracy and precision of isoscape models. We introduce the use of integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to construct isoscape models. Integrated nested Laplace approximation provides a computationally efficient framework to construct spatial models of isotopic variability explicitly addressing additional variation introduced by including multiple reference species (or other recognized sources of variance). We present carbon, nitrogen and sulphur isoscape models extending over c. 1 million km 2 of the UK shelf seas. Models were built using seven different species of jellyfish as spatial reference data and a suite of environmental correlates. Compared to alternative isoscape prediction methods, INLA-spatial isotope models show high spatial precision and reduced variance. We briefly discuss the likely biogeochemical explanations for the observed spatial isotope distributions. We show for the first time that sulphur isotopes display systematic spatial variation across open marine shelf seas and may therefore be a useful additional tool for marine spatial ecology. The INLA technique provides a promising tool for generating isoscape models and associated uncertainty surfaces where reference data are accompanied by multiple, quantifiable sources of uncertainty.},

Warming temperatures, freshening seawater, and disruption to sea-ice formation potentially all have cascading effects on food webs. New approaches are needed to better understand spatiotemporal interactions among biogeochemical processes at the base of Southern Ocean food webs. In marine systems, isoscapes (models of the spatial variation in the stable isotopic composition) of carbon and nitrogen have proven useful in identifying spatial variation in a range of biogeochemical processes, such as nutrient utilization by phytoplankton. Isoscapes provide a baseline for interpreting stable isotope compositions of higher trophic level animals in movement, migration, and diet research. Here, we produce carbon and nitrogen isoscapes across the entire Southern Ocean ({\textgreater}40°S) using surface particulate organic matter isotope data, collected over the past 50 years. We use Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation-based approaches to predict mean annual isoscapes and four seasonal isoscapes using a suite of environmental data as predictor variables. Clear spatial gradients in δ13C and δ15N values were predicted across the Southern Ocean, consistent with previous statistical and mechanistic views of isotopic variability in this region. We identify strong seasonal variability in both carbon and nitrogen isoscapes, with key implications for the use of static or annual average isoscape baselines in animal studies attempting to document seasonal migratory or foraging behaviors.},

	doi = {10.1093/beheco/art037},
	abstract = {Surprisingly, little is known about how the environment influences the production of the iconic orange coloration of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Previous research under controlled laboratory conditions has shown that the temperature during larval development influences the color of monarch wings, where females raised in warm conditions had a greater proportion of melanization, whereas males raised in warm conditions had a lower proportion of melanization. These melanin-based colors have been found to increase flying ability in Lepidoptera, and recent experiments have found that monarchs with redder forewings flew greater distances than monarchs with less intense coloration. We examined whether wild-caught monarchs captured in the Great Lakes region exhibited geographic polyphenism by using stable isotopes to estimate natal origin, and hence rearing temperature, spectrophotometry to measure forewing coloration, and image analysis to estimate shape. We found that monarchs from the Gulf Coast were more melanized than monarchs from the Great Lakes, and southern male monarchs were more saturated than northern male monarchs. This supports previous research suggesting that colors that absorb more solar energy allow for greater flying ability but contradicts the patterns we expected based on natal temperature. Interestingly, this effect of color on migration distance was independent of wing shape. We provide the first evidence that the coloration of wild monarchs influences their migration ability over a continental scale, and we suggest that these differences in color may benefit the cohort of monarchs destined for long-distance migration to their wintering ground. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

Although many hoverfly species exhibit migratory behavior, the spatiotemporal facets of these movement dynamics, and their ecosystem services implications are poorly understood. In this study, we use long-term (16-year) trapping records, trajectory analysis, and intrinsic (i.e., isotope, genetic, pollen) markers to describe migration patterns of the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus in northern China. Our work reveals how E. balteatus migrate northward during spring–summer and exhibits return (long-range) migration during autumn. The extensive genetic mixing and high genetic diversity of E. balteatus populations underscore its adaptive capacity to environmental disturbances, for example, climate change. Pollen markers and molecular gut analysis further illuminate how E. balteatus visits min. 1012 flowering plant species (39 orders) over space and time. By thus delineating E. balteatus transregional movements and pollination networks, we advance our understanding of its migration ecology and facilitate the design of targeted strategies to conserve and enhance its ecosystem services.},

It is widely assumed that diurnal migratory insects use a 'time-compensated sun compass' to adjust for the changing position of the sun throughout the day, as demonstrated in some butterfly species. The mechanisms used by other groups of diurnal insect migrants remain to be elucidated. Migratory species of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) are one of the most abundant and beneficial groups of diurnal migrants, providing multiple ecosystem services and undergoing directed seasonal movements throughout much of the temperate zone. To identify the hoverfly navigational strategy, a flight simulator was used to measure orientation responses of the hoverflies Scaeva pyrastri and Scaeva selenitica to celestial cues during their autumn migration. Hoverflies oriented southwards when they could see the sun and shifted this orientation westward following a 6 h advance of their circadian clocks. Our results demonstrate the use of a time-compensated sun compass as the primary navigational mechanism, consistent with field observations that hoverfly migration occurs predominately under clear and sunny conditions.},

Temporal migration patterns refer to the timing of migration of populations from different breeding latitudes. We investigated the spatial and temporal migration patterns of hatching-year (HY) sharp-shinned hawks Accipiter striatus of interior North America using stable-hydrogen isotope and band encounter analyses. Feather samples were collected from hawks migrating through New Mexico, USA and measured for their stable-hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) to distinguish individuals originating from relatively high and low natal latitudes. We then examined the relationship between feather δD values and passage dates through New Mexico, USA. We also gathered band encounter data from the Bird Banding Lab of the United States Geological Survey to determine the wintering latitudes of HY sharp-shinned hawks relative to their passage date through migration banding sites in interior North America. Combining these data, we found that during fall migration HY sharp-shinned hawks used a chain migration pattern, that is, hawks originating from lower latitudes wintered further south than those from higher latitudes. In addition, birds originating from lower latitudes passed through interior North America earlier than those from higher latitudes. We also found that hawks from higher latitudes were significantly larger than those from lower latitudes, and that females from higher latitudes had significantly higher estimated fat levels than females from lower latitudes.},

With large next-generation sequencing data sets we are now able to ask whether introgression has occurred across the genome, and multiple methods have been proposed to detect the signature of such events. Here, we introduce a new summary statistic that can be used to test for introgression, RNDmin , that makes use of the minimum pairwise sequence distance between two population samples relative to divergence to an outgroup. We find that our method offers a modest increase in power over other, related tests, but that all such tests have high power to detect introgressed loci when migration is recent and strong. RNDmin is robust to variation in the mutation rate, and remains reliable even when estimates of the divergence time between sister species are inaccurate. We apply RNDmin to population genomic data from the African mosquitoes Anopheles quadriannulatus and A. arabiensis, identifying three novel candidate regions for introgression. Interestingly, one of the introgressed loci is on the X chromosome, but outside of an inversion separating these two species. Our results suggest that significant, but rare, sharing of alleles is occurring between species that diverged more than 1 million years ago, and that application of these methods to additional systems are likely to reveal similar results.},

	abstract = {Many animals are inhabited by microbial symbionts that influence their hosts’ development, physiology, ecological interactions, and evolutionary diversification. However, firm evidence for the existence and functional importance of resident microbiomes in larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars) is lacking, despite the fact that these insects are enormously diverse, major agricultural pests, and dominant herbivores in many ecosystems. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and quantitative PCR, we characterized the gut microbiomes of wild leaf-feeding caterpillars in the United States and Costa Rica, representing 124 species from 15 families. Compared with other insects and vertebrates assayed using the same methods, the microbes that we detected in caterpillar guts were unusually low-density and variable among individuals. Furthermore, the abundance and composition of leaf-associated microbes were reflected in the feces of caterpillars consuming the same plants. Thus, microbes ingested with food are present (although possibly dead or dormant) in the caterpillar gut, but host-specific, resident symbionts are largely absent. To test whether transient microbes might still contribute to feeding and development, we conducted an experiment on field-collected caterpillars of the model species Manduca sexta. Antibiotic suppression of gut bacterial activity did not significantly affect caterpillar weight gain, development, or survival. The high pH, simple gut structure, and fast transit times that typify caterpillar digestive physiology may prevent microbial colonization. Moreover, host-encoded digestive and detoxification mechanisms likely render microbes unnecessary for caterpillar herbivory. Caterpillars illustrate the potential ecological and evolutionary benefits of independence from symbionts, a lifestyle that may be widespread among animals.},

	abstract = {In a time with decreasing biodiversity, especially among insects, a detailed understanding about specific resource utilization strategies is crucial. The physiological and behavioural responses to host switches in phytophagous insects are poorly understood. Earlier studies indicate that a host plant switch might be associated with distinctive molecular and physiological responses in different lineages. Expanding the assessment of such associations across Lepidoptera will reveal if there are general patterns in adaptive responses, or if each switch event is more of a unique character. We investigated host plant preference, fitness consequences, effects on expression profiles and gut microbiome composition in two common wood white (Leptidea sinapis) populations with different host plant preferences from the extremes of the species distribution area (Sweden and Catalonia). Our results show that female Catalonian wood whites lack preference for either host plant (Lotus corniculatus or L. dorycnium), while Swedish females laid significantly more eggs on L. corniculatus. Individuals from both populations reared on L. dorycnium had longer developmental times and smaller body size as adults. This indicates that both environmental and genetic factors determine the choice to use a specific host plant. Gene expression analysis revealed a more pronounced response to host plant in the Catalonian compared to the Swedish population. In addition, host plant treatment resulted in a significant shift in microbiome community structure in the Catalonian population. Together, this suggests that population specific plasticity associated with local conditions underlies host plant utilisation in wood whites.},

	doi = {10.3389/fgene.2012.00015},
	abstract = {It is generally accepted that butterfly wing color-patterns have ecological and behavioral functions that evolved through natural selection. However, particular wing color-patterns may be produced physiologically in response to environmental stress, and they may lack significant function. These patterns would represent an extreme expression of phenotypic plasticity and can eventually be fixed genetically in a population. Here, three such cases in butterflies are concisely reviewed, and their possible mechanisms of genetic assimilation are discussed. First, a certain modified color-pattern of Vanessa indica induced by temperature treatments resembles the natural color-patterns of its closely related species of the genus Vanessa (sensu stricto). Second, a different type of color-pattern modification can be induced in Vanessa cardui as a result of a general stress response. This modified pattern is very similar to the natural color-pattern of its sister species Vanessa kershawi. Third, a field observation was reported, together with experimental support, to show that the color-pattern diversity of a regional population of Zizeeria maha increased at the northern range margin of this species in response to temperature stress. In these three cases, modified color-patterns are unlikely to have significant functions, and these cases suggest that phenotypic plasticity plays an important role in butterfly wing color-pattern evolution. A neutral or non-functional trait can be assimilated genetically if it is linked, like a parasitic trait, with another functional trait. In addition, it is possible that environmental stress causes epigenetic modifications of genes related to color-patterns and that their transgenerational inheritance facilitates the process of genetic assimilation of a neutral or non-functional trait. © 2012 Hiyama, Taira and Otaki.},

	abstract = {Background: In plant-feeding insects, the evolutionary retention of polyphagy remains puzzling. A better understanding of the relationship between these organisms and changes in the metabolome of their host plants is likely to suggest functional links between them, and may provide insights into how polyphagy is maintained. Results: We investigated the phenological change of Cynoglossum officinale, and how a generalist butterfly species, Vanessa cardui, responded to this change. We used untargeted metabolite profiling to map plant seasonal changes in both primary and secondary metabolites. We compared these data to differences in larval performance on vegetative plants early and late in the season. We also performed two oviposition preference experiments to test females' ability to choose between plant developmental stages (vegetative and reproductive) early and late in the season. We found clear seasonal changes in plant primary and secondary metabolites that correlated with larval performance. The seasonal change in plant metabolome reflected changes in both nutrition and toxicity and resulted in zero survival in the late period. However, large differences among families in larval ability to feed on C. officinale suggest that there is genetic variation for performance on this host. Moreover, females accepted all plants for oviposition, and were not able to discriminate between plant developmental stages, in spite of the observed overall differences in metabolite profile potentially associated with differences in suitability as larval food. Conclusions: In V. cardui, migratory behavior, and thus larval feeding times, are not synchronized with plant phenology at the reproductive site. This lack of synchronization, coupled with the observed lack of discriminatory oviposition, obviously has potential fitness costs. However, this "opportunistic" behavior may as well function as a source of potential host plant evolution, promoting for example the acceptance of new plants.},

The genome was very complete (single-copy complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs [BUSCO] 97\%), with contigs assembled into presumptive chromosomes using synteny analyses. Our annotation used embryonic, larval, and pupal transcriptomes, and 20 transcriptomes across five different wing developmental stages. Gene annotations showed a high level of accuracy and completeness, with 14,437 predicted protein-coding genes. This annotated genome assembly constitutes an important resource for diverse functional genomic studies ranging from the developmental genetic basis of butterfly color pattern, to coevolution with diverse hostplants.},

However, response of migratory propensity to such stress in Endopterygote insects, especially in several species of Lepidoptera, remains unclear. In this study, larval and adult developmental responses to crowding and food stress were investigated in the migratory moth, Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée). A high larval rearing density significantly reduced pupal mass, survival rate and female fecundity. Larvae developed rapidly under crowding conditions, and time to pupation was 2 days earlier than individuals reared alone. By contrast, short-term starvation and associated compensatory growth prolonged larval duration by 3-4 days and pupal duration by 1-2 days. It also reduced the pupal mass, but showed no detectable effects on female reproductive performance. Both sexes had similar development strategies; however, females seemed to be more sensitive to crowding and food shortage than males. A positive effect was expected if such stress factors acted as cues that triggering a behavioural or physiological shift to a distinct migratory phase. To the contrary, we found no proof that crowding and starvation caused maturation delay in female reproductive development. All treatments did not significantly increase female pre-oviposition period. Therefore, we concluded that life developmental responses to crowding and food shortage in this species were different. Adult migration propensity was not enhanced under such stress conditions during the larval phase.},

However, research on density-mediated flight and reproduction in the global migratory agricultural pest Spodoptera frugiperda is lacking. In this study, flight and reproductive performances in response to larval crowding were investigated in S. frugiperda. We found that larval crowding significantly reduced the pupal and body weights of S. frugiperda. Adults reared under the highest density of 30 larvae/jar had the minimum wing expansion, which was significantly smaller than that of larvae reared under solitary conditions. Larval crowding also significantly increased the pre-oviposition period (POP) and period of first oviposition (PFO) but decreased the lifetime fecundity, flight duration and flight distance. Our results showed that S. frugiperda reared under solitary conditions exhibited higher pupal and body weights and stronger reproductive and flight capacities than those reared under high-density conditions. Larval crowding did not enhance the migration propensity in S. frugiperda adults. In conclusion, larval crowding may not be a major factor affecting FAW migration due to high levels of cannibalism. These findings provide new insights into the population dynamics of S. frugiperda under larval crowding conditions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Each year the Mythimna separate (Walker), undertakes a seasonal, long-distance, multigeneration roundtrip migration between southern and northern China. Despite its regularity, the decision to migrate is facultative, and is controlled by environmental, physiological, hormonal, genetic, and molecular factors. Migrants take off on days 1 or 2 after eclosion, although the preoviposition period lasts ≈7 d. The trade-offs among the competing physiological demands of migration and reproduction are coordinated in M. separata by the "oogenesis-flight syndrome." Larvae that experience temperatures above or below certain thresholds accompanied by appropriate humidity, short photoperiod, poor nutrition, and moderate density tend to develop into migrants. However, there is a short window of sensitivity within 24 h after adult eclosion when migrants can be induced to switch to reproductive residents if they encounter extreme environmental factors including starvation, low temperature and long photoperiod. Juvenile hormone (JH) titer is low before migration but high titers are associated with termination of migratory behavior and the switch to reproduction. Early release of JH by the corpora allata in environmentally stressed 1-d old adults, otherwise destined by larval conditions to be migrants, switches them to residents. Offspring inherit parental additive genetic effects governing migratory behavior. However, they also retain flexibility in expression of both flight and reproductive life history traits. The insect neuropeptide, allatotropin, which activates corpora allata to synthesize JH, controls adult flight and reproduction. Future research directions to better understand regulation of migration in this species are discussed. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

The beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua, a long-distance migratory insect pest, is not a direct target of transgenic Cry1Ac-expressing cotton in China, but nevertheless it has recently become an important pest. Migrants leaving their natal field arrive in other appropriate habitat far away in a short time, often followed by larval outbreaks. S. exigua has low susceptibility to Cry1Ac. However, our results from laboratory experiments identified (i) sublethal effects of Cry1Ac protoxin on larval development rate, larval and pupal weight, and adult lifetime fecundity, and (ii) increased long-flight behavior triggered by Cry1Ac which may contribute to larval outbreaks elsewhere. No significant differences in larval mortality, pupation rate, adult emergence rate, longevity, pre-oviposition period, or oviposition period were observed between controls and larvae fed on artificial diet incorporating a low concentration of Cry1Ac protoxin. The negative sublethal effects on some developmental and reproductive traits and lack of effect on others suggest they do not contribute to the observed severity of S. exigua outbreaks after feeding on Cry1Ac cotton. Interestingly, the percentage of long fliers increased significantly when larvae were reared on diet containing either of two low-dose treatments of Cry1Ac, suggesting a possible increased propensity to disperse long distances triggered by Cry1Ac. We hypothesize that negative effects on development and reproduction caused by Cry1Ac in the diet are offset by increased flight propensity triggered by the poor food conditions, thereby improving the chances of escaping adverse local conditions before oviposition. Increased long-flight propensity in turn may amplify the area damaged by outbreak populations. This phenomenon might be common in other migratory insect pests receiving sublethal doses of Bt toxins and warrants further study. © 2013 Jiang et al.},

Light is a major environmental signal for insect circadian rhythms, and it is also necessary for magnetic orientation. We identified the full-length cDNA encoding As-CRY1 and As-CRY2 in Agrotis segetum Denis and Schiffermaller (turnip moth (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)). The DNA photolyase domain and flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding domain were found in both cry genes, and multiple alignments showed that those domains that are important for the circadian clock and magnetosensing were highly conserved among different animals. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that cry genes were expressed in all examined body parts, with higher expression in adults during the developmental stages of the moths. Under a 14:10 (L:D) h cycle, the expression of cry genes showed a daily biological rhythm, and light can affect the expression levels of As-cry genes. The expression levels of cry genes were higher in the migratory population than in the reared population and higher in the emigration population than in the immigration population. These findings suggest that the two cryptochrome genes characterized in the turnip moth might be associated with the circadian clock and magnetosensing. Their functions deserve further study, especially for potential control of the turnip moth.},

Phylogenetic analysis showed that the transcripts of cry1 and cry2 align closely with other insect crys, indicating within-species divergence of Hacry. A dn/ds analysis revealed that the encoding sequence of the cry1 was under purifying selection by a strong negative selection pressure whereas the cry2 was less constraint and showed a less strong purification selection than cry1. In general, Hacrys were more abundantly transcribed in wild migrating populations than that in laboratory maintained populations, and expression of the cry2 was lower than cry1 in all samples tested. Moreover, when compared with the migrating parental population, offspring reared in laboratory conditions showed a significant reduction on transcription of the cry1 but not cry2. These results strongly suggest that cry1 was more related to the migration behavior of H. armigera than cry2.},

	abstract = {Diets essentially affect the ecological distribution of insects, and may contribute to or even accelerate pest plague outbreaks. The grasshopper, Oedaleus asiaticus B-Bienko (OA), is a persistent pest occurring in northern Asian grasslands. Migration and plague of this grasshopper is tightly related to two specific food plants, Stipa krylovii Roshev and Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. However, how these diets regulate and contribute to plague is not clearly understood. Ecological studies have shown that L. chinensis is detrimental to OA growth due to the presence of high secondary metabolites, and that S. krylovii is beneficial because of the low levels of secondary metabolites. Moreover, in field habitats consisting mainly of these two grasses, OA density has negative correlation to high secondary metabolites and a positive correlation to nutrition content for high energy demand. These two grasses act as a 'push-pull,' thus enabling the grasshopper plague. Molecular analysis showed that gene expression and protein phosphorylation level of the IGF → FOXO cascade in the insulin-like signaling pathway (ILP) of OA negatively correlated to dietary secondary metabolites. High secondary metabolites in L. chinensis down-regulates the ILP pathway that generally is detrimental to insect survival and growth, and benefits insect detoxification with high energy cost. The changed ILP could explain the poor growth of grasshoppers and fewer distributions in the presence of L. chinensis. Plants can substantially affect grasshopper gene expression, protein function, growth, and ecological distribution. Down-regulation of grasshopper ILP due to diet stress caused by high secondary metabolites containing plants, such as L. chinensis, results in poor grasshopper growth and consequently drives grasshopper migration to preferable diet, such as S. krylovii, thus contributing to grasshopper plague outbreaks.},

In butterflies, gustatory receptor genes (GRs) play important roles in host plant selection by ovipositing females. Since several studies have shown associations between the repertoire sizes of chemosensory gene families and the diversity of resource use, we hypothesized that the increase in the number of genes in the GR family is associated with host range expansion in butterflies. Here, we analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of GRs among related species, including the host generalist Vanessa cardui and three specialists. Although the increase of the GR repertoire itself was not observed, we found that the gene birth rate of GRs was the highest in the lineage leading to V. cardui compared with other specialist lineages. We also identified two taxon-specific subfamilies of GRs, characterized by frequent lineage-specific duplications and higher non-synonymous substitution rates. Together, our results suggest that frequent gene duplications in GRs, which might be involved in the detection of plant secondary metabolites, were associated with host range expansion in the V. cardui lineage. These evolutionary patterns imply that the capability to perceive various compounds during host selection was favored during adaptation to diverse host plants.},

In addition, we fed larvae seven fat-free single diets differing in dietary nutrient ratio in no-choice trials to determine the rules of compromise they exhibit when constrained to a singular, sub-optimal dietary source. In choice trials, caterpillars regulated nutrient intake to a ratio of 1 protein to 1.09 carbohydrate (1P:1.09C), exhibiting tighter regulation of protein than of carbohydrate. Furthermore, larvae from different diet pair treatments did not differ in pupal mass or stadium duration. In no-choice experiments, larvae reduced consumption on increasingly protein-biased diets and increased consumption on increasingly carbohydrate-biased diets, relative to a 1P:1C ratio diet. Differences in carbohydrate consumption were much greater between no-choice treatments than differences in protein consumption. Dietary nutrient ratio affected pupal mass when accounting for initial larval mass. Pupal mass decreased as nutrient ratio was shifted off of 1P:1C, but to a greater extent when the ratio was skewed toward carbohydrate. Stadium duration increased as nutrient ratio diverged from 1P:1C, being more pronounced when shifted toward carbohydrate than toward protein. Regulation to near 1P:1C is consistent with results found for other Lepidoptera, and the rule of compromise exhibited by V. cardui is consistent with that expected for a generalist herbivore.},

	abstract = {Ephemeral plants and most tropical crops are available to herbivore insects as irregular and unpredictable patches of resources. Insects that exploit patched habitats usually have well-developed migratory ability, and migration is a fundamental process in the cycle of colonization and extinction of the local populations. We ask here whether Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) uses the aging process of the host plant to modulate its migratory activity. The insect was reared in the laboratory on the leaves from the middle estratum (fourth expanded leaves) of cabbage (Brassica oleraceae var. capitata) of various ages, and on leaves from three strata of the mature plant. Females that spent their larval phase in young and tender plants lived for a shorter period of time and laid eggs immediately after metamorphosis. In contrast, mature plants, particularly the new leaves from the superior stratum, favored the development of adult phenotypic traits that occur in migratory forms, such as reduced body size, increased longevity and delayed reproductive activity. We suggest that the lesser nutritional quality and the short temporal persistence of mature plants are selective forces favoring individuals that are better prepared to abandon their habitat soon after emergence. Plutella xylostella may use the predictable ontogenetic changes of the ephemeral host plant to modulate its physiological and behavioral migratory ability.},

Flight is an important mode of transportation that affects ecological functions, including mate location, foraging, and migration. However, the effects of increasing temperature and diet quality on flight remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the effects of rearing temperature and larval diet quality on the flight ability of an iconic and ecologically threatened migratory insect, the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus. Experimental Design: Monarch larvae were reared at two temperatures (25 °C and 28 °C) and on three milkweed species with varying phytochemistry (Asclepias incarnata, Asclepias syriaca, and Asclepias curassavica) in a fully factorial experiment. We tested flight ability using an automated flight mill, which measured cumulative flight distance, duration, and instantaneous velocity. Results: Higher rearing temperatures reduced monarch flight ability, and larval diet quality influenced forewing morphology. Dietary milkweed with higher cardenolide concentrations (A. curassavica) induced shorter, wider forewings whereas milkweed with low to intermediate cardenolides (A. incarnata and A. syriaca) induced longer, narrower forewings, which are considered better for gliding flight used during migration. Implications for Insect Conservation: Our results provide evidence that projected increases in temperature and the subsequent expansion of tropical milkweed (A. curassavica) into the central breeding range of eastern North American migratory monarchs could reduce migration success. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms explaining the effects of diet and temperature on monarch flight ability and fitness, to ensure that appropriate conservation strategies are employed to preserve migratory populations.},

	abstract = {Animals derive resources from their diet and allocate them to organismal functions such as growth, maintenance, reproduction, and dispersal. How variation in diet quality can affect resource allocation to life-history traits, in particular those important to locomotion and dispersal, is poorly understood. We hypothesize that, particularly for specialist herbivore insects that are in co-evolutionary arms races with host plants, changes in host plant will impact performance. From their coevolutionary arms-race with plants, to a complex migratory life history, Monarch butterflies are among the most iconic insect species worldwide. Population declines initiated international conservation efforts involving the replanting of a variety of milkweed species. However, this practice was implemented with little regard for how diverse defensive chemistry of milkweeds experienced by monarch larvae may affect adult fitness traits. We report that adult flight muscle investment, flight energetics, and maintenance costs depend on the host plant species of larvae, and correlate with concentration of milkweed-derived cardenolides sequestered by adults. Our findings indicate host plant species can impact monarchs by affecting fuel requirements for flight.},

Trial I was conducted at 18 C and food limitation started on day 12; Trials II and III were conducted at 22 C and food limitation started on days 7 and 12. respectively. Larvae were anal{\textasciicircum}'zed for potential differences in both larval and adult weight and time to pupation and emergence. In Trial I, there were more days to pupation and a prolonged adult emergence in the food-limited treatments. Control larvae developed and achieved maximal weights faster than food-limited larvae. Adult weights were also significantly higher in the control. Higher temperature in Trials II and III accelerated larval development. Early onset of food limitation at this higher temperature (Trial II) exacerbated differences among treatments, whereas later onset food limitation dampened these differences .},

Although the GNIP database is instrumental in developing global isoscapes, data coverage in some regions of hydrological interest (e.g., drylands) is low or non-existent thus the accuracy and relevance of global isoscapes to these regions is debatable. Capitalizing on existing literature isotope data, we generated rainfall isoscapes for Namibia (dryland) using the cokriging method and compared it to a globally fitted isoscape (GFI) downscaled to country level. Results showed weak correlation between observed and predicted isotope values in the GFI model (r2 {\textless} 0.20) while the cokriging isoscape showed stronger correlation (r2 = 0.67). The general trend of the local cokriging isoscape is consistent with synoptic weather systems (i.e., influences from Atlantic Ocean maritime vapour, Indian Ocean maritime vapour, Zaire Air Boundary, the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Tropical Temperate Troughs) and topography affecting the region. However, because we used the unweighted approach in this method, due to data scarcity, the absolute values could be improved in future studies. A comparison of local meteoric water lines (LMWL) constructed from the cokriging and GFI suggested that the GFI model still reflects the global average even when downscaled. The cokriging LMWL was however more consistent with expectations for an arid environment. The results indicate that although not ideal, for data deficient regions such as many drylands, the unweighted cokriging approach using historical local data can be an alternative approach to modelling rainfall isoscapes that are more relevant to the local conditions compared to using downscaled global isoscapes.},

Throughout the range of plants tested there was an overall trend for the newly moulted adult to synthesise and store a reserve of lipid and to lose most of the stored glycogen accumulated during the nymphal stage. N. lugens has two wing morphs, and whilst lipid deposits were greatest in the macropterous ‘migrant’ males, in females it was the brachypterous ‘reproductive’ insects that had the highest lipid deposits and also the greatest residual body weight. However, because of their lower body weight, the macropterous females had the greater percentage of lipid. Both flight willingness and the percentage of macropterous females showing flight-orientated physiological development increased with the age of the host-plant. Both survival and migration potential were lower in insects reared on the resistant rice variety compared to those reared on the susceptible variety. The pattern of post-flight resynthesis of fuels suggests that more than one major migration is unlikely. © 1983, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aim: Migratory species depend on various habitats and resources along their migration routes. Characteristics such as dependence on distinct habitats and the presence of multiple threats along their migratory routes make these species vulnerable, and gaps in knowledge about their ecology and migration processes make them difficult to conserve. Urania boisduvalii is a diurnal moth endemic to Cuba that feeds on plants of Omphalea spp. during its larval phases. These plants produce secondary metabolites as a defence against the moth's larvae, which then are forced to migrate. Although some ecological aspects of Urania boisduvalii are known, its migration routes remain largely unknown. This research proposes potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii among populations of its host plant. Location: Cuba. Methods: We developed ecological niche models of the moth and its hosts based on environmental, anthropic, biotic and biogeographic factors to obtain potential distributional areas that include zones where positive interactions are found but exclude those where negative factors are present. These areas were overlapped to hypothesize potential breeding areas for the moths. Potential migratory corridors were proposed based on environmental connectivity. Results: The moth and its hosts have broad potential distributions; however, limiting factors have substantially reduced these areas, especially for plants. The potential migratory routes of Urania boisduvalii are complex and mostly involve the western and eastern regions of Cuba. Most records outside potential breeding areas were close to these migratory corridors. Main conclusions: We offer initial hypotheses of the migratory routes of U. boisduvalii, which may be useful to guiding monitoring projects that can provide more definitive views of the seasonal distribution of this species across the Cuban archipelago.},

While S. frugiperda exhibits a considerable dispersal capacity and engages in long-distance migration, there's only scant information on the species' flight capability. Here, we empirically assessed S. frugiperda flight activity under varying climatic conditions using a flight mill. More specifically, under laboratory conditions, FAW exhibited superior flight performance at 20–25°C and 60–90\% relative humidity (RH). When quantifying flight performance over five consecutive nights (i.e., 10 h/night), all flight parameters initially increased and then gradually dropped and FAW adults attained a total flight distance, duration and velocity equal to 63.73 km (48.42–94.12 km) (median, quartile range), 24.12 h (20.87–27.73 h) and 2.73 km h−1 (2.13–3.33 km h−1), respectively. Our work constitutes a first comprehensive assessment of S. frugiperda flight performance and provides baseline information for future efforts to forecast spatiotemporal changes in its geographical distribution, movement patterns and invasion trajectories. Such can ultimately permit a timely and targeted deployment of area-wide pest management measures against this newly-invasive pest in China and across eastern Asia.},

	abstract = {The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) is native to the Americas and a major pest of corn and several other crops of economic importance. The species has characteristics that make it of particular concern as an invasive pest, including broad host range, long-distance migration behavior, and a propensity for field-evolved pesticide resistance. The discovery of fall armyworm in western Africa in 2016 was followed by what was apparently a remarkably rapid spread throughout sub-Saharan Africa by 2018, causing economic damage estimated in the tens of billions USD and threatening the food security of the continent. Understanding the history of the fall armyworm invasion of Africa and the genetic composition of the African populations is critical to assessing the risk posed to different crop types, the development of effective mitigation strategies, and to make Africa less vulnerable to future invasions of migratory moth pests. This paper tested and expanded on previous studies by combining data from 22 sub-Saharan nations during the period from 2016 to 2019. The results support initial descriptions of the fall armyworm invasion, including the near absence of the strain that prefers rice, millet, and pasture grasses, while providing additional evidence that the magnitude and extent of FAW natural migration on the continent is more limited than expected. The results also show that a second entry of fall armyworm likely occurred in western Africa from a source different than that of the original introduction. These findings indicate that western Africa continues to be at high risk of future introductions of FAW, which could complicate mitigation efforts.},

	abstract = {An initial destabilization of functions triggered by drought stress in plants is followed by acclimatization and acquisition of tolerance; however, knowledge remains limited on drought-mediated changes in plant quality for herbivores. We tested whether a water-stressed fast-growing plant negatively affects host-specialist insects in both sap-sucking and leaf-chewing feeding guilds. Collards (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) were grown in well-watered, slightly water-stressed and severely water-stressed conditions. Decreasing soil moisture adversely affected plant development, assessed as a reduction in leaf number and size, stomatal size and relative water content. Severely stressed plants had less fiber and glucosinolates; however, they showed more total nitrogen and lipids. Larval survival, pupal weight, reproductive rate (Ro) and rate of population growth (r) were lower when the leaf-chewing Plutella xylostella was reared with severely stressed collards. In multiple-choice tests, moths laid fewer eggs on leaf discs of collard that were exposed to drought. The fecundity of the sap-sucking Brevicoryne brassicae was higher and the development of alates was lower when insects were fed on plants kept in well-watered regime as compared to slight-stress and severe-stress. Despite higher nitrogen content and fewer glucosinolates, a higher level of leaf surface wax in severely stressed collards possibly decreased food quality for both herbivores. Thus, host-specific herbivores of different guilds showed similar responses to drought-stressed, fast-growing plants. Water-stressed crops could discourage the attack of specialist insects, but the intensity of the stress that is required to achieve this effect will greatly reduce crop production, in terms of plant growth or foliage increment.},

Previous studies have indicated that oviposition preference and offspring performance of Lepidoptera insects are sensitive to drought separately. However, the integration of their two properties is not always seen. Here, we evaluated changes in oviposition selection and offspring fitness of a Lepidoptera insect under three water-stressed treatments using a model agroecosystem consisting of maize Zea mays, and Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis. Results found that female O. furnacalis preferred to laying their eggs on well-watered maize, and then their offspring tended to survive better, attained bigger larvae mass, and developed more pupae and adults on the preferred maize. Oviposition selection of O. furnacalis positively correlated with height and leaf traits of maize, and offspring fitness positively related with water content and phytochemical traits of hosts. Overall, these results suggest that oviposition choice performed by O. furnacalis reflects the maximization of offspring fitness, supporting preference-performance hypothesis. This finding further highlights that the importance of simultaneous evaluation of performance and performance for water driving forces should be involved, in order to accurately predict population size of O. furnacalis under altered precipitation pattern.},

	abstract = {Increased frequency and severity of drought, as a result of climate change, is expected to drive critical changes in plant–insect interactions that may elevate rates of tree mortality. The mechanisms that link water stress in plants to insect performance are not well understood. Here, we build on previous reviews and develop a framework that incorporates the severity and longevity of drought and captures the plant physiological adjustments that follow moderate and severe drought. Using this framework, we investigate in greater depth how insect performance responds to increasing drought severity for: (i) different feeding guilds; (ii) flush feeders and senescence feeders; (iii) specialist and generalist insect herbivores; and (iv) temperate versus tropical forest communities. We outline how intermittent and moderate drought can result in increases of carbon-based and nitrogen-based chemical defences, whereas long and severe drought events can result in decreases in plant secondary defence compounds. We predict that different herbivore feeding guilds will show different but predictable responses to drought events, with most feeding guilds being negatively affected by water stress, with the exception of wood borers and bark beetles during severe drought and sap-sucking insects and leaf miners during moderate and intermittent drought. Time of feeding and host specificity are important considerations. Some insects, regardless of feeding guild, prefer to feed on younger tissues from leaf flush, whereas others are adapted to feed on senescing tissues of severely stressed trees. We argue that moderate water stress could benefit specialist insect herbivores, while generalists might prefer severe drought conditions. Current evidence suggests that insect outbreaks are shorter and more spatially restricted in tropical than in temperate forests. We suggest that future research on the impact of drought on insect communities should include (i) assessing how drought-induced changes in various plant traits, such as secondary compound concentrations and leaf water potential, affect herbivores; (ii) food web implications for other insects and those that feed on them; and (iii) interactions between the effects on insects of increasing drought and other forms of environmental change including rising temperatures and CO2 levels. There is a need for larger, temperate and tropical forest-scale drought experiments to look at herbivorous insect responses and their role in tree death.},

	abstract = {In tropical forests, drought and herbivory represent two potent stresses on seedlings. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of severe droughts in many tropical forests, which may influence seedling vulnerability to herbivores if drought stress affects seedling palatability. Furthermore, contrasting selective pressures in wetter vs drier forests could mean that species well-adapted to herbivores are less drought resistant and vice versa. In this study, we measured seedling performance and herbivory in a common garden experiment where seedlings of 15 tree species were subjected to irrigation or rainfall exclusion treatments across two dry seasons in Panama. Water manipulation had no effects on foliar herbivory during the experiment for all species combined and for 14 of the 15 focal species when analyzed separately. There was large variation among species in herbivore damage, but no relationship between the sensitivity of species to drought and the amount of herbivory they experienced. Altogether, our findings suggest that increasing drought stress is unlikely to directly alter tropical tree seedling susceptibility to herbivore attack in this forest. Additional studies are needed to determine whether drought alters tropical plant-herbivore interactions via other mechanisms, such as through changes in herbivorous insect communities and/or increases in fitness costs of herbivory.

	doi = {10.1111/mec.16178},
	abstract = {Predicting how climate change affects biotic interactions poses a challenge. Plant–insect herbivore interactions are particularly sensitive to climate change, as climate-induced changes in plant quality cascade into the performance of insect herbivores. Whereas the immediate survival of herbivore individuals depends on plastic responses to climate change-induced nutritional stress, long-term population persistence via evolutionary adaptation requires genetic variation for these responses. To assess the prospects for population persistence under climate change, it is therefore crucial to characterize response mechanisms to climate change-induced stressors, and quantify their variability in natural populations. Here, we test developmental and transcriptomic responses to water limitation-induced host plant quality change in a Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulation. We combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the plant metabolome, larval developmental assays and an RNA sequencing analysis of the larval transcriptome. We observed that responses to feeding on water-limited plants, in which amino acids and aromatic compounds are enriched, showed marked variation within the metapopulation, with individuals of some families performing better on control and others on water-limited plants. The transcriptomic responses were concordant with the developmental responses: families exhibiting opposite developmental responses also produced opposite transcriptomic responses (e.g. in growth-associated transcripts). The divergent responses in both larval development and transcriptome are associated with differences between families in amino acid catabolism and storage protein production. The results reveal intrapopulation variability in plasticity, suggesting that the Finnish M. cinxia metapopulation harbours potential for buffering against drought-induced changes in host plant quality.},

I test if the butterfly Vanessa cardui, which can use some of its larval food plants as nectar sources, is able to rationalize this search problem by combining the two search tasks. Lab-experiments revealed a higher oviposition preference for Cirsium arvense over Urtica dioica and a corresponding difference in larval performance. Contrary to predictions, there was no effect of inflorescences on oviposition. However, experiments in large outdoor cages showed a higher occupancy and a higher level of oviposition in patches with access to nectar sources, even on U. dioica. Hence, while there was no preference for individual plants with flowers, the results suggests that V. cardui is simplifying its search task to primarily search for hosts in nectar-rich patches. This strategy allows females to increase oviposition rate, but it is likely that it comes at the expense of not always using optimal host plants in terms of offspring performance. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is hypothesized to be a useful predictor of population canalization, especially for organisms at risk from environmental change. Identification of traits that meet statistical criteria as FA measures remains a challenge. Here, a laboratory experiment subjected immature butterflies (Vanessa cardui) to diet and temperature conditions of varying stress levels. Variation in dietary macronutrient ratio (protein: carbohydrate) and rearing temperature (optimal: 25°C; elevated: 32°C) was introduced as stressors. Temperature and nutrition are key variables influencing ectotherm growth and fitness and so are likely to be important stressors that influence FA. Individuals subjected to stressful conditions were predicted to show elevated FA of three wing size traits, as well as increased mortality and decreased adult body size. Trait FA did not vary across treatments. Instead, treatment levels impacted viability: The combined incidence of pupal death and expression of significant wing malformations increased in treatment levels designated as stressful. Variation in adult dry mass also reflected predicted stress levels. Results suggest that individuals predicted to display increased FA either died or displayed gross developmental aberrations. This experiment illustrates important constraints on the investigation of FA, including selection of appropriate traits and identification of appropriate levels of stressors to avoid elevated mortality. The latter concern brings into question the utility of FA as an indicator of stress in vulnerable, natural populations, where stress levels cannot be controlled, and mortality and fitness effects are often not quantifiable.},

We investigated the effect of three different N application rates (low, medium, and high) and two CO2 levels (ambient and elevated) on wheat growth and quality and the development and performance of the bird cherry-oat aphid, a major cereal pest worldwide, under controlled environmental conditions. We found that eCO2 significantly decreased total aphid fecundity and wheat N content by 22 and 39\%, respectively, when compared to ambient CO2 (aCO2). Greater N application significantly increased total aphid fecundity and plant N content but did not offset the effects of eCO2.

One prominent hypothesis is that poor-quality food promotes development of migratory phenotypes and this has been clearly shown for some polyphenic insects. In other animals, particularly long-distance bird migrants, it is clear that high-quality food is required to prepare animals for a successful migration. We tested the effect of diet quality on the flight behaviour and morphology of the Mongolian locust, Oedaleus asiaticus. Locusts reared at high population density and fed low-N grass (performance-enhancing for this species) had enhanced migratory morphology relative to locusts fed high-N grass. Furthermore, locusts fed synthetic diets with an optimal 1: 2 protein: carbohydrate ratio flew for longer times than locusts fed diets with lower or higher protein: carbohydrate ratios. In contrast to the hypothesis that performance-degrading food should enhance migration, our results support the more nuanced hypothesis that high-quality diets promote development of migratory characteristics when migration is physiologically challenging.},

	abstract = {A primary function of adult winged insects is dispersal. Limiting larval dietary intake (partial starvation) has been shown to affect the flight muscle metabolism of adult moths reared on artificial diet, but a more ecologically relevant question is whether natural variation in host plant quality can lead to differences in the flight capacity of adult insects. Recent studies have shown that inbreeding compromises plant antiherbivore defences. We created inbred and outbred progeny from locally collected horsenettle (Solanum carolinense L.) and examined how host plant inbreeding affects the growth, development, and flight muscle physiology of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta L.), a specialist herbivore on Solanaceae. We tested the hypothesis that within population genetic variation in host plant quality, resulting from inbreeding, can create significant changes to the larval development and flight physiology of an adult insect. We found that Manduca larvae reared on inbred horsenettle plants grew faster and developed into larger pupae compared to larvae reared on outbred plants. Adult flight metabolic rate was greater in adults reared on inbred plants compared to outbred plants, and this elevation was independent of body mass when we excluded one plant family that produced small, low metabolic rate moths regardless of breeding regime. Differences in mass-specific flight metabolism were associated with changes in alternative splicing of troponin t, a flight muscle protein that regulates muscle contraction. These results show that host plant inbreeding can create effects that cascade through larval and pupal development to affect dispersal-related traits of the adult stage. Hence, plant inbreeding may also impact herbivore population dynamics, particularly their ability to spread away from, and possibly into, isolated patches of inbred plants creating increased herbivore pressure on these plant populations. More generally, our findings reveal that changes in population biology at one trophic level can affect the metabolic physiology and flight capacity of an animal at a higher trophic level.},

In basal flying insects such as Odonata, genomic research regarding bauplan evolution is still rare. Here we focus on the world’s largest odonate species—the “forest giant” Megaloprepus caerulatus, to explore its potential for looking deeper into the development and evolution of wings. A recently discovered cryptic species complex in this genus previously considered monotypic is characterized by morphological differences in wing shape and color patterns. As a first step toward understanding wing pattern divergence and pathways involved in adaptation and speciation at the genomic level, we present a transcriptome profiling of M. caerulatus using RNA-Seq and compare these data with two other odonate species. The de novo transcriptome assembly consists of 61,560 high quality transcripts and is approximately 93\% complete. For almost 75\% of the identified transcripts a possible function could be assigned: 48,104 transcripts had a hit to an InterPro protein family or domain, and 28,653 were mapped to a Gene Ontology term. In particular, we focused on genes related to wing development and coloration. The comparison with two other species revealed larva-specific genes and a conserved ‘core’ set of over 8,000 genes forming orthologous clusters with Ischnura elegans and Ladona fulva. This transcriptome may provide a first point of reference for future research in odonates addressing questions surrounding the evolution of wing development, wing coloration and their role in speciation.},

We also discuss how Drosophila was used as a model to facilitate our understanding of the role of zinc in neurodegenerative diseases.},

	abstract = {Stable isotopic landscape modeling has become a promising approach for answering research questions in multiple disciplines. However, its application has been hindered by the difficulty for individual researchers to collect, compile, and integrate environmental and isotopic data over large spatial and temporal scales and to develop and interpret geostatistical models. To address these challenges, we developed IsoMAP (http://isomap.org), a science gateway that enables researchers to access and integrate a number of disparate and diverse datasets, develop isoscape models over selected spatiotemporal domains using geostatistical algorithms, predict maps for the stable isotopic ratios, and associate a sample's isotope value with its most likely geographic origin. One main challenge in developing IsoMAP is to efficiently integrate large heterogeneous datasets into the modeling workflow to ensure real-time query response and timely data update. In this paper, we described how the geospatial data processing workflow was implemented in the initial version of gateway and how it has been improved by leveraging the built-in vector and raster data processing capabilities and the materialized view object of the PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. Our experience and lessons learned will be applicable to the development of other geospatial data workflows, a common task in the cyberinfrastructure of many science disciplines.},

	abstract = {A new interpretation is presented of the concept of 'critical concentrations' of metal pollutants for invertebrates in terrestrial ecosystems. Four critical concentrations are proposed for essential metals such as zinc and copper in the diet (C,, Cb, Cc, Cd) which separate five 'levels of performance'. These range from 'deficiency' (level 5) through 'homeostasis' (level 4), 'low excess' (level 3), 'high excess' (level 2) to 'lethal' (level 1). Level 5 does not exist for non-essential metals such as cadmium and lead. The values of the critical concentrations for a specific metal and species may fluctuate with time and will depend on the presence or absence of additional stress factors which act on the animal such as other metals in the diet, climatic changes and food availability. Cc may be set at any concentration between Cb and Cd and could represent the maximum 'acceptable' level of pollution; its precise value will depend on the parameters used to indicate when an individual or a population of a particular species passes from 'low excess' (level 3 -acceptable) to 'high excess' (level 4 -unacceptable) of the metal in the diet. Cb, Cc and Cd are defined for zinc in the diet of the terrestrial isopod Porcellio scaber Latreille, 1804 and the intracellular pathways for the detoxification of metals are compared with those of a predator, the woodlouse-eating spider Dysdera crocata C.L. Koch, 1838. The difficulties of defining Cc in a 'regulator' of metals (D. crocata) in comparison to a metal 'accumulator' (P. scaber) are discussed.},

	abstract = {The interplay between nutrition and the microbial communities colonizing the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., gut microbiota) determines juvenile growth trajectory. Nutritional deficiencies trigger developmental delays, and an immature gut microbiota is a hallmark of pathologies related to childhood undernutrition. However, how host-associated bacteria modulate the impact of nutrition on juvenile growth remains elusive. Here, using gnotobiotic Drosophila melanogaster larvae independently associated with Acetobacter pomorumWJL (ApWJL) and Lactobacillus plantarumNC8 (LpNC8), 2 model Drosophila-associated bacteria, we performed a large-scale, systematic nutritional screen based on larval growth in 40 different and precisely controlled nutritional environments. We combined these results with genome-based metabolic network reconstruction to define the biosynthetic capacities of Drosophila germ-free (GF) larvae and its 2 bacterial partners. We first established that ApWJL and LpNC8 differentially fulfill the nutritional requirements of the ex-GF larvae and parsed such difference down to individual amino acids, vitamins, other micronutrients, and trace metals. We found that Drosophila-associated bacteria not only fortify the host's diet with essential nutrients but, in specific instances, functionally compensate for host auxotrophies by either providing a metabolic intermediate or nutrient derivative to the host or by uptaking, concentrating, and delivering contaminant traces of micronutrients. Our systematic work reveals that beyond the molecular dialogue engaged between the host and its bacterial partners, Drosophila and its associated bacteria establish an integrated nutritional network relying on nutrient provision and utilization.},

	abstract = {Following the genomics revolution, our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying defenses against stress has been greatly expanded. Under strong selective pressure many animals may evolve an enhanced stress tolerance. This can be achieved by altering the structure of proteins (through mutations in the coding regions of genes) or by altering the amount of protein (through changes in transcriptional regulation). The latter type of evolution can be achieved by substitutions in the promoter of the gene of interest (cis-regulatory change) or by altering the structure or amount of transcriptional regulator proteins (trans-regulatory change). The metallothionein system is one of the best studied stress response systems in the context of heavy metals. Metallothionein expression is assumed to be regulated by metal transcription factor 1 (MTF-1); however, up to now the involvement of MTF-1 has only been proven for some vertebrates and Drosophila. Data on invertebrates such as nematodes and earthworms suggest that other mechanisms of metallothionein induction may be present. A detailed study of Cd tolerance was done for a species of soil-living springtail, Orchesella cincta. The metallothionein gene of this species is overexpressed in metal-exposed field populations. Analysis of the metallothionein promoter has demonstrated extensive polymorphisms that have a functional significance, as shown in bioreporter assays. In a study comparing 20 different populations, the frequency of a high-expresser promoter allele was positively correlated with the concentration of metals in soil, especially Cd. The springtail study shows that cis-regulatory change of genes involved in the cellular stress response may contribute to evolution of metal tolerance. © Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

This review also highlights the different oxidized, apoprotein and metalated forms of MTs, the diversity of interactions they can establish with different molecules and their central and multifunctional cellular role.

They play important roles in a variety of key cellular processes, resulting in a varying degree of dependence on metals for different organisms. While most effort has been placed on identifying metal metabolic pathways and characterizing metalloproteins and their functions, computational and systematical analyses of the metallomes (or metalloproteomes) have been limited. In the past several years, comparative genomics of the metallomes has arisen, which provides significant insights into the metabolism and function of metals as well as their evolution. This review focuses on recent progress in comparative genomic analysis of trace metals (such as copper, molybdenum, nickel, cobalt, selenium, iron and zinc) in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These studies reveal distinct and dynamic evolutionary patterns of the utilization of different metals and metalloproteins. We also discuss advances in comparative metagenomic analysis of metals in microbial communities in diverse environments such as the global marine ecosystem, which offer new clues to the relationship between metal utilization and different types of environmental factors. Overall, comparative genomic and metagenomic analyses of the metallomes provide a foundation for systematic understanding of metal utilization, function and related evolutionary trends in the three domains of life.},

All of the butterflies that sipped water with a Na+ concentration of 13 mM absorbed Na+ and excreted K+, although certain butterflies that sipped solutions with high concentrations of Na+ excreted Na+. According to the Na+ concentrations observed in naturally occurring water sources, water with a Na+ concentration of up to 10 mM appears to be optimal for the health of male Japanese Papilio butterflies. The molar ratio of K+ to Na+ observed in leaves was 43.94 and that observed in flower nectars was 10.93. The Na+ amount in 100 g of host plant leaves ranged from 2.11 to 16.40 mg, and the amount in 100 g of flower nectar ranged from 1.24 to 108.21 mg. Differences in host plants did not explain the differences in the frequency of puddling observed for different Japanese Papilio species. The amounts of Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ in the meconium of both male and female butterflies were also measured, and both males and females excreted more K+ than the other three ions. Thus, the fluid that was excreted by butterflies at emergence also had a role in the excretion of the excessive K+ in their bodies. The quantities of Na+ and K+ observed in butterfly eggs were approximately 0.50 μg and 4.15 μg, respectively; thus, female butterflies required more K+ than male butterflies. Therefore, female butterflies did not puddle to excrete K+. In conclusion, the purpose of puddling for male Papilio butterflies is not only to absorb Na+ to correct deficiencies but also to excrete excessive K+.},

It has been suggested that metal pollution is one potentially very important reason for the decline. Recently, a recovery of P. apollo and widening of its range has started in the southwestern Finland, simultaneously with a decline in metal fallout from air. Metal analyses were performed with larval and host plant samples collected from an area where P. apollo is recolonising its former range (the archipelago between the island of Kemiö and the Hankoniemi peninsula). In the host plants (Sedum telephium), the level of Fe was significantly lower and the levels of Cd and Zn suggestively lower in the current range (n = 35) of P. apollo than in the former range (n = 12). Analyses on larvae of P. apollo (n = 29) showed lower levels of Cd, Fe and Mn than in the host plant leaves. The excretion of these metals, as well as Zn, via the faeces was effective. The level of the Cd-antagonist Cu was considerably higher in caterpillars than in the food. When caterpillars were fed with metal-polluted food from Helsinki city (4.35 ppm Cd/dwt; n = 5) they died, whereas control individuals fed with food from the archipelago (2.49 ppm Cd/dwt: n = 5) survived. These results indicate that metals may play an important role in the large-scale decline and partial recovery of P. apollo in the western Europe.},

We measured the concentrations of nickel and copper, forewing length, and fluctuating asymmetry in two elements of wing patterns in Boloria euphrosyne, Plebejus idas, and Agriades optilete collected 1–65 km from Monchegorsk. Body metal concentrations increased toward the smelter, confirming the local origin of the collected butterflies. The wings of butterflies from the most polluted sites were 5–8\% shorter than those in unpolluted localities, suggesting adverse effects of pollution on butterfly fitness due to larval feeding on contaminated plants. However, fluctuating asymmetry averaged across two hindwing spots did not change systematically with pollution, thereby questioning the use of fluctuating asymmetry as an indicator of habitat quality in butterfly conservation projects.},

To examine how I. lathonia caterpillars cope with the naturally high foliar zinc concentration of V. calaminaria, we compared the growth of caterpillars reared on leaves varying in zinc concentration. Larvae were fed in controlled conditions with V. calaminaria and V. tricolor grown on noncontaminated soil (i.e., two low-Zn diets) and with V. calaminaria grown on zinc-enriched soil (i.e., one high-Zn diet). Larvae had a higher growth rate when fed with noncontaminated V. calaminaria compared to zinc-enriched V. calaminaria, suggesting that zinc slows down larval growth. However, larvae consumed more leaves of zinc-enriched V. calaminaria (+45\%; estimated from fecal mass) compared with noncontaminated V. calaminaria, suggesting that zinc accumulation would not be advantageous to plants. Caterpillars reared on high-zinc leaves regulate their internal zinc concentration through excretion of highly metal-concentrated feces. When kinetics of growth on both low-zinc diets were compared, it appeared that larval development was faster on noncontaminated V. calaminaria than on V. tricolor. This suggests that more nutrients or less feeding inhibitors in V. calaminaria account for fastest growth. Developmental rates on V. tricolor and on zinc-enriched V. calaminaria were similar, despite the high leaf zinc concentration of the latter species. Together with the abundance of V. calaminaria on calamine soils, this may explain why the largest populations of I. lathonia develop on V. calaminaria in Belgium. © 2007 SETAC.},

Compartmentalized zinc is utilized in fertilization, embryogenesis and for the activation of zinc-finger transcription factors — the latter function demonstrated during muscle development, while dietary zinc is sensed through gating of a chloride channel. Another emerging theme in cellular metal homeostasis is that transporters and related proteins meet at endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria associated membranes with physiologically relevant consequences during aging.},

Median Pb concentrations of C. coelolepis muscle (0.009–0.056 wet ppm) and liver (0.023–0.061 wet ppm) are among the lowest encountered in shark records. Stable Pb isotope imprints in adult C. coelolepis muscles highlight that most of Pb in C. coelolepis is from human origin. Lead isotopes reveal the persistence of gasoline Pb emitted in the 1970s in low-turnover adult shark's muscle while associated liver imprints are in equilibrium with recent pollutant Pb signatures suggesting an efficient pollutant Pb turnover metabolism. The comparison of Pb distribution between adult and juvenile cohorts suggests the role of dietary exposure and possible maternal offloading of Pb during gestation, likely associated to vitellogenesis in this aplacental viviparous deep-sea shark.},

Our understanding of the chemistry of cuticular sclerotization has increased considerably since Mark Pryor in 1940 suggested that enzymatically generated ortho-quinones react with free amino groups, thereby crosslinking the cuticular proteins. The results obtained since then have confirmed the essential features of Pryor's suggestion, and the many observations and experiments, which have been obtained, have led to a detailed and rather complex picture of the sclerotization process, as described in this review. However, many important questions still remain unanswered, especially regarding the precise regional and temporal regulation of the various steps in the process. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Through human activity lead has become a serious environmental neurotoxin, known to affect activity levels, attention and both sensory and cognitive function in children. Study of lead would be facilitated by having a model system that could be manipulated easily and quickly. We find Drosophila melanogaster ideal as such, and we have been studying effects of lead on courtship, fecundity and locomotor activity. We raised Canton-S flies from eggs to adult day 6-7 on medium made with lead acetate solution (2-100 μg/g), or with distilled water, and we measured adult body lead burdens by means of Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). To measure courtship effectiveness, five virgin females and five virgin males were transferred into an empty vial and the number of females that mated within 20 min was recorded. To measure fecundity, all adult offspring from eggs produced by one female within 12 days of mating were counted. To measure locomotor activity, individual flies were transferred to a grid-labeled petri dish and the number of lines crossed in 30 s was counted. The number of females mating within 20 min was increased significantly by exposure to 2 or 8 μg/g lead, and was decreased significantly by exposure to 20 or 50 μg/g lead. Fecundity was increased significantly by exposure to 2 μg/g lead, but was unaffected by exposure to 20 μg/g lead. Locomotor activity was consistently higher for males than for females, and was significantly reduced only by exposure to 50 μg/g lead, and then only for males. We thus defined for Drosophila a lowest observable effect level (LOEL) of 2 μg/g lead, which is considerably lower than the doses shown previously to affect this animal. The dose-response curve was biphasic for the number of females mating within 20 min, an example of hormesis, a non-linear response that has been reported for low levels of stressors as diverse as pollutants and radiation. We hope from further studies with Drosophila to understand better how lead affects the developing nervous system, and thus ultimately its effects on children. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

The soil of studied berseem fields were slightly alkaline, silty loam in texture and moderate in organic matter. In soil, the concentration of Zn and Pb were under permissible level while Cd was above the permissible level. The accumulation of metals in T. alexandrinum were found in the order Zn {\textgreater} Cd {\textgreater} Pb. Grasshoppers showed higher accumulation of Pb than of Cd and Zn. In the soil-berseem-aphid-beetle food chain, metal enrichment was recorded. However, aphids did not show bioaccumulation for Cd. Metals accumulation in beetles showed that translocation of Zn, Cd, and Pb was taking place in the third trophic level. Our study highlights the mobility of metals in insect food chains and showed that insect feeding style greatly influenced the bioaccumulation. However, different metals showed variable bioaccumulation rates depending on their toxicity and retention.},

In this study, the effects of Pb stress (12.5–50 mg Pb/kg in larval artificial diets) on the reproduction of the common cutworm Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) were investigated after 7 generations. The results showed that Pb stress did not reduce the longevity of adult females, but 50 mg Pb/kg significantly reduced the longevity of adult males, regardless of the generation. After 50 mg Pb/kg stress for one or 7 generations, the peak time of egg-laying was delayed, and egg production and hatchability were decreased significantly. The vitellin content in eggs was significantly inhibited by Pb stress. The S. litura vitellogenin (Vg) gene promoter was cloned and analyzed. Multiple putative transcription factors were predicted for the 2321 bp Vg promoter region, including the TATA box, GATA, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, Broad-Complex (BR-C) binding sites, etc. The fragment from −2222 to −211 bp of the Vg promoter was the activation domain for Vg, whereas the region from −211 to −55 bp repressed the activity of the Vg promoter. The construct promoter (−782/+76) in Trichoplusia ni (Hi5) cells significantly improved Vg expression, which was not affected by Pb stress (1 or 10 mg/ml). Therefore, Pb stress significantly inhibited the reproduction of S. litura but not by regulating the Vg promoter.},

Using calcium isotopes, we investigate preserved biogenic isotope compositions in a set of dinosaur teeth from three continental formations from Alberta, Canada, to assess latest Cretaceous food web structure. Tooth enamel δ44/42Ca values are presented for tyrannosaurids (n = 34) and potential large herbivorous prey (n = 42) in the upper Campanian Dinosaur Provincial Park Formation, upper-most Campanian–Maastrichtian Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and upper Maastrichtian–lower Paleocene Scollard Formation, spanning the last {\textasciitilde}10 m.y. of the Cretaceous. The influence of diagenesis is assessed in a subset sample through major and trace elemental concentrations and ultraviolet (UV) Raman spectra, which provides a framework for interpreting calcium isotope values. In the Dinosaur Park Formation, hadrosaurid δ44/42Ca values are systematically heavier than ceratopsid values, a difference that is interpreted to reflect niche partitioning among megaherbivores. Tyrannosaurid δ44/42Ca values are scattered but on average, they are 44Ca-depleted relative to herbivorous dinosaurs in all three formations. As interpreted from the Dinosaur Park data set, tyrannosaurids may have preferentially fed on hadrosaurids. These analyses offer possibilities for testing whether trophic structure among non-avian dinosaur ecosystems changed several millions of years prior to the K–Pg boundary.},

Average delta values for 66 Zn/ 64 Zn in the water striders were approximately 0.7‰ lighter (−1.2‰ ± 1.0‰) and were significantly different than those measured for stoneflies (−0.45‰ ± 0.62‰) and caddisflies (−0.51‰ ± 0.54‰). Nitrogen isotope ratios were significantly different ( P {\textless} 0.05) among the three species suggesting differences in trophic positioning. Similar to the Zn isotope ratios, δ 13 C values for the water striders (−28.61‰ ± 0.98‰) were significantly different than those of the stoneflies and caddisflies, i.e., −30.75‰ ± 1.33‰ and −30.68‰ ± 1.01‰, respectively.

Using a multi-modal imaging and analysis approach, we have investigated iron in the honeybee, with a particular focus on the abdomen and the utility of such techniques as applied to magnetoreception. Abdominal iron is shown to accumulate rapidly, reaching near maximum levels only 5 days after emerging from the comb and is associated with the accumulation of iron within the fat body. While fat body iron could be visualized, no regions of interest, other than perhaps the fat body itself, were identified as potential sites for magnetoreceptive cells. If an iron-based magnetoreceptor exists within the honeybee abdomen the large accumulation of iron in the fat body is likely to impede its discovery.},

	abstract = {Diversity and biomass of aquatic insects decline in metal-rich aquatic environments, but the mechanisms by which insects from such environments cope with potentially toxic metal concentrations to survive through adulthood are less well understood. In this study, we measured Zn concentrations and isotopes in laboratory-reared diatoms and mayflies (Neocloeon triangulifer) from larval through adult stages. The larvae were fed Zn-enriched diatoms, and bio-concentrated Zn by a factor of 2.5–5 relative to the diatoms but maintained the same Zn-isotopic ratio. These results reflect the importance of dietary uptake and the greater rate of uptake relative to excretion or growth. Upon metamorphosis to subimago, Zn concentrations declined by {\textgreater} 70\%, but isotopically heavy Zn remained in the subimago bodies. We surmised that the loss of isotopically light Zn during metamorphosis was due to the loss of detoxified Zn and retention of metabolically useful Zn. Through the transition from subimago to imago, Zn concentrations and isotope ratios were virtually unchanged. Because the decrease in Zn body concentration and increase in heavier Zn are seen in the subimagos relative to the larvae, the compartmentalization of Zn must be occurring within the larvae. A biodynamic model was constructed, allowing for isotopic fractionation and partitioning of Zn between metabolically essential and detoxified Zn reservoirs within larvae. The model provides a consistent set of rate and fractionation constants that successfully describe the experimental observations. Specifically, metabolically essential Zn is isotopically heavier and is tightly held once assimilated, and excess, isotopically light Zn is sequestered, detoxified, and ultimately lost during the metamorphosis of larvae to subimagos. To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of in vivo isotopic fractionation in insects, offering an improved understanding of the mechanisms and rates by which the N. triangulifer larvae regulate excess Zn in their bodies.},

	abstract = {The final step in morphogenesis of the adult fly is wing maturation, a process not well understood at the cellular level due to the impermeable and refractive nature of cuticle synthesized some 30 h prior to eclosion from the pupal case. Advances in GFP technology now make it possible to visualize cells using fluorescence after cuticle synthesis is complete. We find that, between eclosion and wing expansion, the epithelia within the folded wing begin to delaminate from the cuticle and that delamination is complete when the wing has fully expanded. After expansion, epithelial cells lose contact with each other, adherens junctions are disrupted, and nuclei become pycnotic. The cells then change shape, elongate, and migrate from the wing into the thorax. During wing maturation, the Timp gene product, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, and probably other components of an extracellular matrix are expressed that bond the dorsal and ventral cuticular surfaces of the wing following migration of the cells. These steps are dissected using the batone and Timp genes and ectopic expression of αPS integrin, inhibitors of Armadillo/β-catenin nuclear activity and baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35. We conclude that an epithelial-mesenchymal transition is responsible for epithelial delamination and dissolution. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Its molecular identity as an approximately 30 kDa bioactive heterodimer consisting of two cystine knot proteins resisted elucidation for 43 years. The sequence of the two bursicon subunits is highly conserved among arthropods, and this conservation extends even to echinoderms. We review the efforts leading to bursicon's characterization, the identification of its leucine-rich repeat-containing, G protein-coupled receptor (LGR2), and the progress towards revealing its various functions. It is now clear that bursicon regulates different aspects of wing inflation in Drosophila melanogaster besides being involved at various points in the cuticle tanning process in different insects. We also describe the current knowledge of the expression of bursicon in the central nervous system of different insects in large homologous neurosecretory cells, and the changes in its expression during the development of Manduca sexta and D. melanogaster. Although much remains to be learned, the elucidation of its molecular identity and that of its receptor has provided the breakthrough needed for investigating the diverse actions of this critical insect neurohormone. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {The wings of Lepidoptera contain a matrix of living cells whose function requires appropriate temperatures. However, given their small thermal capacity, wings can overheat rapidly in the sun. Here we analyze butterfly wings across a wide range of simulated environmental conditions, and find that regions containing living cells are maintained at cooler temperatures. Diverse scale nanostructures and non-uniform cuticle thicknesses create a heterogeneous distribution of radiative cooling that selectively reduces the temperature of structures such as wing veins and androconial organs. These tissues are supplied by circulatory, neural and tracheal systems throughout the adult lifetime, indicating that the insect wing is a dynamic, living structure. Behavioral assays show that butterflies use wings to sense visible and infrared radiation, responding with specialized behaviors to prevent overheating of their wings. Our work highlights the physiological importance of wing temperature and how it is exquisitely regulated by structural and behavioral adaptations.},

	abstract = {Although there has been much speculation in the literature that methylmercury (MeHg) exposure can reduce songbird fitness, little is known about its effects on migration. Migrating songbirds typically make multiple flights, stopping to refuel for short periods between flights. How refueling at MeHg-contaminated stopover sites would contribute to MeHg bioaccumulation, and how such exposure could affect subsequent flight performance during migration has not been determined. In a dosing experiment we show that migratory yellow-rumped warblers (Setophaga coronata) rapidly accumulate dietary MeHg in blood, brain and muscle, liver and kidneys in just 1–2 weeks. We found that exposure to a 0.5 ppm diet did not affect vertical takeoff performance, but in 2-h wind tunnel flights, MeHg-treated warblers had a greater median number of strikes (landing or losing control) in the first 30 min, longer strike duration, and shorter flight duration. The number of strikes in the first 30 min of 0.5 ppm MeHg-exposed warblers was related to mercury concentration in blood in a sigmoid, dose-dependent fashion. Hyperphagic migratory songbirds may potentially bioaccumulate MeHg rapidly, which can lead to decreased migratory endurance flight performance. Migratory songbirds are potentially at risk to quickly increase mercury body burden through contaminated diets at stopovers, which can impair their flight ability in the following migration.},

	abstract = {Butterflies have been of great interest to naturalists for centuries, and the study of butterflies has been an integral part of ecology and evolution ever since Darwin proposed his theory of natural selection in 1859. There are {\textgreater} 18 000 butterfly species worldwide, showing great diversity in morphological traits and ecological niches. Compared with butterfly diversity, however, patterns of genome size variation in butterflies remain poorly understood, especially in a phylogenetic context. Here, we sequenced and assembled the mitogenomes of 68 butterflies and measured the genome sizes (C-values) of 67 of them. We also assembled 10 mitogenomes using reads from GenBank. Among the assembled 78 mitogenomes, those from 59 species, 23 genera and one subfamily are reported for the first time. Combining with published data of mitogenomes and genome size, we explored the patterns in genome size variation for 106 butterfly species in a phylogenetic context based on analyses of mitogenomes from 264 species covering six families. Our results show that the genome size of butterflies has a 6.4-fold variation ranging from 0.203 pg (199 Mb) (Nymphalidae: Heliconius xanthocles) to 1.287 pg (1253 Mb) (Papilionidae: Parnassius orleans). Within families, the largest variation was found in Papilionidae (5.9-fold: 0.22–1.29 pg), followed by Nymphalidae (4.8-fold: 0.2–0.95 pg), Pieridae (4.4-fold: 0.22–0.97 pg), Hesperiidae (2.2-fold: 0.3–0.66 pg), Lycaenidae (2.6-fold: 0.39–1.02 pg) and Rioidinidae (1.8-fold: 0.48–0.87 pg). Our data also suggest that butterflies have an ancestral genome size of c. 0.5 pg, and some ancestral genome size increase or decrease events along different subfamilies or tribes produce the diversity of genome size variation in diverse butterflies. Our data provide novel insights into patterns of genome size variation in butterflies and are an important reference for future genome sequencing programmes.},

	abstract = {We tested two hypotheses that assume aspects of host-plant quality restrict the current distribution of Parnassius apollo. The "foreign host-plant hypothesis" states that host plants from outside the current range of P. apollo are, for some reason, unsuitable for the developing larvae. The "heavy-metal hypothesis" specifically attributes this unsuitability to a higher concentration of heavy metals (especially Cd) outside the current species' range than inside. We fed 60 larvae from two populations with host plants from their place of origin (control) or from an area outside the current distribution of the species (treatment). Treatment plants had lower Cd levels, which allowed us to separate between the two hypotheses. Larvae in the treatment group experienced positive effects on fitness-related traits such as weight at pupation, length of the last instar and food consumption. Hence, Cd appears to have a negative effect on developing P. apollo larvae and may therefore restrict the recolonisation of current populations into their former range. However, larvae from one population tolerated a concentration of Cd equally high as what was previously shown to be lethal. Such tolerance undermines the generality of attributing the decline and restrictions of P. apollo populations to high Cd concentrations. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2005.},

	abstract = {Insect declines are being reported worldwide for flying, ground, and aquatic lineages. Most reports come from western and northern Europe, where the insect fauna is well-studied and there are considerable demographic data for many taxonomically disparate lineages. Additional cases of faunal losses have been noted from Asia, North America, the Arctic, the Neotropics, and elsewhere. While this review addresses both species loss and population declines, its emphasis is on the latter. Declines of abundant species can be especially worrisome, given that they anchor trophic interactions and shoulder many of the essential ecosystem services of their respective communities. A review of the factors believed to be responsible for observed collapses and those perceived to be especially threatening to insects form the core of this treatment. In addition to widely recognized threats to insect biodiversity, e.g., habitat destruction, agricultural intensification (including pesticide use), climate change, and invasive species, this assessment highlights a few less commonly considered factors such as atmospheric nitrification from the burning of fossil fuels and the effects of droughts and changing precipitation patterns. Because the geographic extent and magnitude of insect declines are largely unknown, there is an urgent need for monitoring efforts, especially across ecological gradients, which will help to identify important causal factors in declines. This review also considers the status of vertebrate insectivores, reporting bias, challenges inherent in collecting and interpreting insect demographic data, and cases of increasing insect abundance.},

Dose-dependent relationships between Ni levels and food consumption and growth were variable with different larval developmental period and Ni exposure duration. RCR, AD and RGR of the 6th instar larvae were much more affected by Ni exposure than those of 5th instar larvae, and the effects were strongest in the 3rd generation. It was found that RCR was significantly stimulated after 1 and 20mgkg-1 Ni exposure, while AD was significantly inhibited after 1, 5, 10 and 40mgkg-1 Ni exposure. However, lower levels of Ni (≤5mgkg-1) significantly increased and higher levels of Ni (≥10mgkg-1) significantly decreased RGR. In 3 successive generations, 10mgkg-1 Ni significantly increased the ECI and ECD of the 5th instar larvae, and 5mgkg-1 Ni significantly increased the ECD of the 6th instar larvae. However, ECD were all significantly inhibited with 20mgkg-1 Ni exposure. Results also revealed that durations of larvae were shortened at low levels of Ni, but extended at high levels of Ni. Fecundity was inhibited by the highest Ni doses in each generation, while improved by low Ni doses in the 3rd generation. Hatching rates in all treatments were significantly decreased in a Ni dose-dependent manner.

The method consists of two components: an advanced weather forecast model, MM5, for weather simulation, and a migration model for trajectory calculation. The weather forecast model simulates wind fields in which trajectories are calculated by the migration model. 2 It is assumed that planthoppers, Sogatella furcifera and Nilaparvata lugens, are transported at wind speeds and in wind directions. The method is evaluated using a migration event observed at Chikugo in Japan on 25 June 1969, which was recorded in hourly catch data. 3 The results indicate that the takeoff responsible for the migration occurred at 21 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on 23 June along the coastal region of Fujian province in China. This is the first time that the source region of this event has been accurately identified. Determinations of the migrating duration and height are also consistent with observations. 4 Although the landing process is not considered in the model, it is shown that the method is able to simulate the migration and accurately estimate various parameters. This study also shows the importance of high-quality weather simulation.},

Other means that can be used to assess the occurrence of altitudinal migration are briefly mentioned. Two types of migration, the dormancy-associated and dormancy-independent types, are discriminated. In the former type, insects usually breed in spring, migrate to high-altitude areas in late spring or early summer, usually for aestivation, and return to low-altitude areas in autumn. In this type, the same individuals perform upward and downward migration. In the latter type, insects also perform upward migration in late spring or early summer and downward migration in autumn, but they breed both in low- and high-altitude areas.

Arguably, there is no butterfly for which flight is more important than the monarch ( Danaus plexippus ), which undergoes long-distance migrations in North America. We examined morphological features of monarchs that would explain the apparent higher migratory success and flight ability of females over males. We examined 47 male and 45 female monarch specimens from a project where monarchs were reared under uniform conditions. We weighed individual body parts, including the thorax (flight muscle) and wings, and computed wing loading and wing thickness for all specimens. When we compared each morphological trait between sexes, we found that females did not differ from males in terms of relative thorax (wing muscle) size. Females were generally smaller than males, but females had relatively thicker wings than males for their size, which suggests greater mechanical strength. Importantly, females had significantly lower wing loading than males (7\% lower). This would translate to more efficient flight, which may explain their higher migratory success. Results of this work should be useful for interpreting flight behavior and/or migration success in this and other Lepidopteran species.},

	abstract = {Due to the straightforward and non-invasive sampling, ease of transport and long-term storage and access to time-resolved information, determination of element concentrations and isotope ratios in hair and nails finds increasing use. Multi-isotopic information preserved in keratinous tissues allows one to reveal dietary, physiological and environmental influences, but progress in this area is still limited by complicated and time-consuming analytical procedures and challenges in accuracy assessment. In this study, longitudinal distributions of δ34S, 87Sr/86Sr, 207,208Pb/206Pb, δ66Zn, δ56Fe, δ65Cu, δ26Mg, and δ114Cd were obtained for hair and nails collected from nine subjects with different age, biological sex, diet and/or place of residence. For S and Zn, the distribution along hair strands revealed a trend towards a heavier isotopic signature from the proximal to the distal end, with a maximum difference within the hair of a single subject of 1.2‰ (Δ34S) and 0.4‰ (Δ66Zn). For Fe, Cu, Mg and Cd, a shift towards either a lighter (Cu) or heavier (Fe, Mg and Cd) isotopic composition is accompanied by increasing concentration towards the distal hair end, indicating possible isotope fractionation during deposition or external contamination with a different isotopic composition. Pb and Sr isotope ratios are relatively stable throughout the hair strands despite notable concentration increases towards the distal end, likely reflecting external contamination. The isotopic composition of Sr points to tap water as a probable main source, explaining the relative stability of the ratio for individuals from the same geographical location. For Pb, isotopic compositions suggest tap water and/or indoor dust as possible sources. Similar δ34S, 87Sr/86Sr, 207,208Pb/206Pb, δ66Zn, δ56Fe, and δ65Cu observed for hair, fingernails and toenails sampled from the same individual suggest that keratinous tissues are conservative receivers of internal and external inputs and can be used complementary. Seasonal variation in δ34S, 207,208Pb/206Pb, and δ65Cu was observed for fingernails.},

Clearly, the determinants of bioavailability and bioaccessibility must be understood if one is to monitor or, ultimately, predict the effects of metals. On the basis of a dynamic conceptual model, this article offers an analysis of the physicochemical and biological determinants underlying bioavailability and bioaccessibility. This analysis is used as the basis for a general monitoring strategy for assessing potentially and actually available and accessible metal fractions in the environmental matrices of water, soil, and sediment. We conclude that, lack of a universal expression of bioavailable and bioaccessible metal fractions precludes the presentation of a detailed monitoring strategy that is broadly applicable. Instead, we recommend that a critical assessment of the endpoints of determination become the basis for a need-specific monitoring strategy. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Humans live in complex socio-ecological systems where we interact with parasites and pathogens that spend time in abiotic and biotic environmental reservoirs (e.g., water, air, soil, other vertebrate hosts, vectors, intermediate hosts). Through a synthesis of published literature, we reviewed the life cycles and environmental persistence of 150 parasites and pathogens tracked by the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease study. We used those data to derive the time spent in each component of a pathogen's life cycle, including total time spent in humans versus all environmental stages. We found that nearly all infectious organisms were “environmentally mediated” to some degree, meaning that they spend time in reservoirs and can be transmitted from those reservoirs to human hosts. Correspondingly, many infectious diseases were primarily controlled through environmental interventions (e.g., vector control, water sanitation), whereas few (14\%) were primarily controlled by integrated methods (i.e., combining medical and environmental interventions). Data on critical life history attributes for most of the 150 parasites and pathogens were difficult to find and often uncertain, potentially hampering efforts to predict disease dynamics and model interactions between life cycle time scales and infection control strategies. We hope that this synthetic review and associated database serve as a resource for understanding both common patterns among parasites and pathogens and important variability and uncertainty regarding particular infectious diseases. These insights can be used to improve systems-based approaches for controlling environmentally mediated diseases of humans in an era where the environment is rapidly changing.},

	abstract = {Intestinal helminths of fish are of increasing interest as potential bioindicators for heavy metal contamination in aquatic habitats. Among these parasites cestodes and acanthocephalans in particular have an enormous heavy metal accumulation capacity exceeding that of established free living sentinels. Metal concentrations several thousand times higher in acanthocephalans than in host tissues were described from field and laboratory studies. Whereas larval stages inside their intermediate hosts are not able to take up high quantities of metals, young worms begin to take up metals immediately after infection of the final host. After four to five weeks of exposure, the parasites reach a steady-state concentration orders of magnitude higher than the ambient water level. Thus, acanthocephalans are not only very effective in taking up metals, but they can also respond very rapidly to changes in environmental exposure. The mechanism which enable acanthocephalans to take up metals from the intestinal lumen of the host appears to be based on the presence of bile acids, which form organo-metallic complexes that are easily absorbed by the worms due to their lipophilicity. Investigations of the environmental conditions affecting metal uptake have shown that the parasites are more consistent and reliable indicators for metal pollution than the host tissues as metal levels of the latter are much more dependent on the water chemistry. Thus, after some years of research on the uptake of metals by acanthocephalans and on the factors affecting metal accumulation in intestinal parasites it should be asked if acanthocephalans meet the criteria commonly accepted for sentinels. If parasites can be considered as promising sentinels, we need reasons for the establishment of 'new' indicators. Therefore, this review summarises the present knowledge about parasites as bioindicators and compares the accumulation properties of parasites and established free living indicators. Finally, this review presents possible answers to the question why it could be advantageous to have new and even more sensitive indicators for environmental monitoring purposes.},

Over the last 20 years, three main research directions have been shown to be highly promising and relevant, namely parasites as accumulation indicators for selected pollutants, parasites as effect indicators, and the role of parasites interacting with established bioindicators. The current paper focuses on the potential use of parasites as indicators of environmental pollution and the interactions with their hosts. By reviewing some of the most recent findings in the field of environmental parasitology, we summarize the current state of the art and try to identify promising ideas for future research directions. In detail, we address the suitability of parasites as accumulation indicators and their possible application to demonstrate biological availability of pollutants; the role of parasites as pollutant sinks; the interaction between parasites and biomarkers focusing on combined effects of parasitism and pollution on the health of their hosts; and the use of parasites as indicators of contaminants and ecosystem health. Therefore, this review highlights the application of parasites as indicators at different biological scales, from the organismal to the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Mercury is a global pollutant that has been widely shown to adversely affect reproduction and other endpoints related to fitness and health in birds, but almost nothing is known about its effects on migration relative to other life cycle processes. Here I consider the physiological and histological effects that mercury is known to have on non-migrating birds and non-avian vertebrates to identify potential mechanisms by which mercury might hinder migration performance. I posit that the broad ability of mercury to inactivate enzymes and compromise the function of other proteins is a single mechanism by which mercury has strong potential to disrupt many of the physiological processes that make long-distance migration possible. In just this way alone, there is reason to expect mercury to interfere with navigation, flight endurance, oxidative balance, and stopover refueling. Navigation and flight could be further affected by neurotoxic effects of mercury on the brain regions that process geomagnetic information from the visual system and control biomechanics, respectively. Interference with photochemical reactions in the retina and decreases in scotopic vision sensitivity caused by mercury also have the potential to disrupt visual-based magnetic navigation. Finally, migration performance and possibly survival might be limited by the immunosuppressive effects of mercury on birds at a time when exposure to novel pathogens and parasites is great. I conclude that mercury pollution is likely to be further challenging what is already often the most difficult and perilous phase of a migratory bird’s annual cycle, potentially contributing to global declines in migratory bird populations.},

	abstract = {A review of recent studies published over a 23-year timespan (1990-2012) showed rapidly increasing interest in exploring how environmental contaminants and parasitism might influence each other and (or) interact to affect host health. Those experimental and observational studies fall into three broad categories (comparative studies of the possible influence of each factor on the other, correlative studies between contaminants and parasitism, and studies on relative bioaccumulation of contaminants by parasites versus their hosts). Despite the exponential increase in relevant studies, little attention has been paid to how contaminants and parasitism should co-occur among individuals within host populations and (or) how the nature of co-distributions should be incorporated into study designs and analyses. Null expectations of co-distributions between contaminants and parasitism can be derived from underlying distributions of each factor. Using a subset of studies, we found contaminant distributions showed positive skew in about one third of cases testing for correlations between contaminant concentrations and parasitism among hosts. We show such skew is expected for theoretical reasons. We used this information to guide simulations wherein the oft-cited negative binomial distribution of parasitism (also supported by theory) was combined with both log-normal (skewed) and normal distributions of contaminants to generate expected null co-distributions. Simulations demonstrated an increasingly concave (or L-shaped) co-distribution with increasing contaminant positive skew: proportionately more individuals experience low levels of each factor while few to none experienced high contaminant and high parasite burdens simultaneously. Our results have the following implications: they call into question experimental studies exposing specimens to parasites and pollutants at levels higher than, or even equal to, observed averages, and they provide a framework for exploring how individual-based effects might scale up into effects at the population level. Potential improvements to study designs and (or) statistical tests are offered that recognize the need to understand the underlying distributions of both contaminants and parasitism and the degree to which one can infer host population effects.},

Here, we present δ88/86Sr values and 87Sr/86Sr ratios for granitoid rocks, a 150yr soil chronosequence formed from these rocks, surface waters and plants in a small glaciated watershed in the central Swiss Alps. Incipient chemical weathering in this young system, whether of inorganic or biological origin, has no resolvable effect on the 87Sr/86Sr ratios and δ88/86Sr values of bulk soils, which remain indistinguishable from bedrock in terms of Sr isotopic composition. Although due in part to the chemical heterogeneity of the forefield, the lack of a resolvable difference between soil and bedrock isotopic composition indicates that these soils have thus far witnessed minimal net loss of Sr; a low degree of chemical weathering is also implied by bulk soil chemistry. The isotopic composition of Sr in streamwater is more radiogenic than median soil, reflecting the preferential weathering of biotite in the catchment; streamwater δ88/86Sr values, however, are indistinguishable from bulk soil δ88/86Sr values, implying that no resolvable fractionation of Sr isotopes takes place during release to the weathering flux in the Damma forefield. Analyses of plant tissue reveal that plants (Rhododendron and Vaccinium) preferentially assimilate the lighter isotopes of Sr such that their δ88/86Sr values are significantly lower than those of the soils in which they grow. Additionally, δ88/86Sr values of foliar and floral tissues are lower than those of roots, contrary to observations for Ca, for which Sr is often used as an analogue in weathering studies. We suggest that processes that discriminate against Sr in favour of Ca, due to the different nutritional requirement of plants for these two elements, are responsible for the observed contrast. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

By carefully monitoring and controlling the accumulation of the on-peak backgrounds (i.e. the carryover memory) on the instrument, our method can provide an external precision of around ±0.010‰ to ±0.014‰ for δ 88/86Sr measurements. Such precision is comparable to that achieved by double-spike TIMS method (DS-TIMS), and 2-3 times better than those of the previously reported results by MC-ICP-MS without spiking. The results of the standard seawater IAPSO are also identical to those by DS-TIMS. However, our method is more advantageous, efficient and convenient to use for routine Sr isotopic analysis than the DS-TIMS method as there is no need to prepare and calibrate the 84Sr-87Sr double spike. Using this method, we measured the δ 88/86Sr values in a series of international geological rock standards, which show large variability, with the lowest value (±0.20‰) registered in JG-2, a terrestrial granite, and the highest value (0.539‰) in UB-N, a serpentinite.

Data currently available concerning global insect abundance trends invariably suffer from phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal bias. Here, we suggest that to follow the real global changes in insect (and all other taxa) communities, biases or shortcomings in data collection must be avoided. An optimised scheme would maximise phylogenetic, functional, habitat, spatial and temporal coverage with minimum investment. Standardised sampling would provide primary data, on a first step in the form of abundance and biomass. Individuals would then be identified to species level whenever possible, with a morphospecies approach or genetics serving as intermediate steps, complementing or even final steps for non-described species. If standardised abundance and ecological data can be readily made available, biodiversity trends can be tracked in real time and allow us to predict and prevent an impending global insect apocalypse.},

However, the pros and cons have to be considered, and the safe disposal of large amounts of radionuclide wastes is becoming a matter of great concern. These wastes encompass contaminants such as heavy metals and toxic substances, which may exist in solid, liquid or gaseous forms or a combination of these, and as such, their disposal requires particular attention.

Written by expert contributors, it addresses occurrence, detection and extraction of strontium, the chemical and nuclear properties of strontium isotopes, the fate and migration of strontium in soil, its bioaccumulation, and its associated health impact, mechanistic toxicity response as well as related regulation and remediation.

	abstract = {This article presents the results of a workplace protection factor (WPF) study for half-facepiece respirators conducted in an aircraft paint spraying operation. The major elements of the paint overspray collected with ambient samples were titanium, strontium, chromium, and silicon. The major elements collected on the in facepiece samples were chlorine and silicon. The geometric mean (GM) ambient concentrations of chromium and titanium varied significantly among painting locations and paint types. There was a significant difference in GM in facepiece concentrations of titanium among painting locations. However, no significant difference in GM in-facepiece concentrations of chromium by location was found. In both ambient and in- facepiece samples the amounts of chromium and strontium were highly correlated as expected. In ambient samples total airborne mass was highly correlated with levels of chromium and titanium when primer and top coat were applied, respectively. No difference in respirator performance, measured by in-facepiece concentration and WPF, was observed during the application of top coat. During the application of primer. Respirator 1 had a significantly higher GM in-facepiece concentration level of chromium and a correspondingly lower GM WPF value than respirators 2 and 3. The 5th percentile estimates for all WPF data or different subsets of WPF data partitioned by paint type and respirator were much greater than 10. Measured WPF values and in-facepiece exposure levels were significantly correlated with an R' of 0.5\%. When the half-facepiece respirators, equipped with high-efficiency/organic vapor combination air purifying elements, were conscientiously worn, used in conjunction with existing controls, and were properly maintained, they provided effective worker protection.},

This study reveals that differences among Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in soils and plants themselves are comparable to or greater than differences due to biopurification and preclude the use of these ratios for the quantitative assessment of dietary plant/meat ratios. The data also reveal that much of this variation at the base of the food web is removed at higher trophic positions through the extraordinary effectiveness of bone in providing a long-term statistical average of diet composition. This reduction in variation effects a pronounced correlation between Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca at higher levels of biopurification such that, given either Ba/Ca or Sr/Ca, a strong constraint can be placed upon the other ratio. This provides a tool for directly assessing whether measured Ba/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios are biological or reflect substantial post-mortem alteration.},

	abstract = {Reproduction in moths and butterflies is a dynamic process that is influenced by various endogenous physiological processes and exogenous factors. The Lepidoptera may be divided into four distinct groups based on their gonadotropic hormones and other reproductive and biological characteristics, regardless of phylogenetic relationships. Some species have integrated their reproduction tightly with the endocrine events of metamorphosis, the waxing or waning ecdysteroid levels. Other species rely instead on juvenile hormone (JH), in part or solely. Species of Lepidoptera that rely on JH as the gonadotropic signal also exhibit polyandry. Several mechanisms have been suggested for the occurrence of polyandry, including availability of male-transferred nutrients (gonadotrophic effect), need for additional sperm, and increased genetic variability. We propose an additional reason for polyandry observed in some lepidopterans. If a female remains a virgin, her endogenous gonadotropic signal diminishes, and eggs that have been produced already may be resorbed to increase longevity. During copulation, the male may trigger a neural/humoral response in the female, thus stimulating release of her endogenous gonadotropic signal, JH, and/or inhibiting degradation of the same, whence she matures new eggs. The mating effect appears to act humorally on the cephalic structures in several species. Whether this change in JH titer is due to an effect on synthesis and release by corpora allata only or occurs in conjunction with inhibition of JH degradation is unknown. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecology and evolution of migratory animals requires information on how populations are geographically linked between periods of the annual cycle. To examine whether trace elements could be used to track migratory birds, we analyzed concentrations of 42 trace elements in feathers of western sandpipers (Calidris mauri (Cabanis, 1857)) that were grown at five different wintering sites ranging from San Francisco Bay (USA) to the Bay of Panama. Linear discriminant analysis of 15 elements correctly classified all 26 individuals to their wintering sites, including two sites that were separated by less than 3 km. A randomization procedure confirmed the robustness of these findings. Our analysis suggests that trace elements can be used to assign individuals to specific sites of origin. Although we did not sample feathers from all wintering areas, the regions our sites represented comprised a significant percentage of the global population. However, since trace element profiles appear to be highly specific to geographic sites, we suggest that this technique is best suited for cases where samples can be obtained from the majority of populations throughout a species range. Thus, under certain circumstances, trace element profiles may provide the potential to identify populations with a high degree of spatial accuracy. © 2007 NRC.},

We conducted a bibliometric analysis on scientific publications between 2000 and 2020. We found 1872 publications for the nine categories of pollutants. We described the wide range of impacts, from direct mortality to sublethal effects, including fitness reduction. Interactions between these pollutants exist, and they can exceed the effects of the pollutants by themselves. Despite this, interactions between pollutants are still understudied and require more targeted research efforts. Threats to avian species and anthropic pollutants are still increasing over time, making mitigation measures a high priority for the preservation of these species. This review can be used as a baseline for conservationists and decision-makers to understand the various scopes of the threats that bird species are facing.},

Although occurring at low densities in the plains as larvae, when they estivate gregariously densities reach high levels, so that any chemicals carried by them are concentrated. One such chemical is arsenic, which is concentrated to phytotoxic levels in the soils surrounding estivation sites. Vegetation may recover as arsenic is made unavailable by time or by fire. This may be a cyclical process that has occurred many times in the past. Bogong moths are an important food for birds and small mammals, and arsenic has been found in the food chain, although bird deaths and population declines in small mammals cannot be positively ascribed to arsenic. Genetic studies and studies looking at the chemical form of the arsenic have so far been unable to confirm the source of the arsenic; however, interception of moths on their spring migration confirms that the source is away from the mountains. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.},

	abstract = {Iron sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and the molybdenum cofactor (Moco) are present at enzyme sites, where the active metal facilitates electron transfer. Such enzyme systems are soluble in the mitochondrial matrix, cytosol and nucleus, or embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, but virtually absent from the cell secretory pathway. They are of ancient evolutionary origin supporting respiration, DNA replication, transcription, translation, the biosynthesis of steroids, heme, catabolism of purines, hydroxylation of xenobiotics, and cellular sulfur metabolism. Here, Fe-S cluster and Moco biosynthesis in Drosophila melanogaster is reviewed and the multiple biochemical and physiological functions of known Fe-S and Moco enzymes are described. We show that RNA interference of Mocs3 disrupts Moco biosynthesis and the circadian clock. Fe-S-dependent mitochondrial respiration is discussed in the context of germ line and somatic development, stem cell differentiation and aging. The subcellular compartmentalization of the Fe-S and Moco assembly machinery components and their connections to iron sensing mechanisms and intermediary metabolism are emphasized. A biochemically active Fe-S core complex of heterologously expressed fly Nfs1, Isd11, IscU, and human frataxin is presented. Based on the recent demonstration that copper displaces the Fe-S cluster of yeast and human ferredoxin, an explanation for why high dietary copper leads to cytoplasmic iron deficiency in flies is proposed. Another proposal that exosomes contribute to the transport of xanthine dehydrogenase from peripheral tissues to the eye pigment cells is put forward, where the Vps16a subunit of the HOPS complex may have a specialized role in concentrating this enzyme within pigment granules. Finally, we formulate a hypothesis that (i) mitochondrial superoxide mobilizes iron from the Fe-S clusters in aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase; (ii) increased iron transiently displaces manganese on superoxide dismutase, which may function as a mitochondrial iron sensor since it is inactivated by iron; (iii) with the Krebs cycle thus disrupted, citrate is exported to the cytosol for fatty acid synthesis, while succinyl-CoA and the iron are used for heme biosynthesis; (iv) as iron is used for heme biosynthesis its concentration in the matrix drops allowing for manganese to reactivate superoxide dismutase and Fe-S cluster biosynthesis to reestablish the Krebs cycle.},

The development of this product is part of an effort to meet the growing demand for longer temporal duration and more frequent, accurate, and consistent land cover and change information. To accomplish this, we designed a new land cover strategy and developed comprehensive methods, models, and procedures for NLCD 2016 implementation. Major steps in the new procedures consist of data preparation, land cover change detection and classification, theme-based postprocessing, and final integration. Data preparation includes Landsat imagery selection, cloud detection, and cloud filling, as well as compilation and creation of more than 30 national-scale ancillary datasets. Land cover change detection includes single-date water and snow/ice detection algorithms and models, two-date multi-index integrated change detection models, and long-term multi-date change algorithms and models. The land cover classification includes seven-date training data creation and 14-run classifications. Pools of training data for change and no-change areas were created before classification based on integrated information from ancillary data, change-detection results, Landsat spectral and temporal information, and knowledge-based trajectory analysis. In postprocessing, comprehensive models for each land cover theme were developed in a hierarchical order to ensure the spatial and temporal coherence of land cover and land cover changes over 15 years. An initial accuracy assessment on four selected Landsat path/rows classified with this method indicates an overall accuracy of 82.0\% at an Anderson Level II classification and 86.6\% at the Anderson Level I classification after combining the primary and alternate reference labels. This methodology was used for the operational production of NLCD 2016 for the Conterminous United States, with final produced products available for free download.},

	abstract = {The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the proportion of variance explained by a statistical model and is an important summary statistic of biological interest. However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called R2 GLMM for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

We used a network approach to find biogeographic regions (bioregions) based on high-resolution species distribution models for 151 endemic bird taxa. Then, we used dated molecular phylogenies of 14 genera to reconstruct the area history through a sequence of allopatric speciation processes. We identified 15 biogeographical regions and found 26 events of isolation and diversification within their boundaries that are independently confirmed with disjunct distributions of sister taxa. Furthermore, these events are spatially congruent with six geographical barriers related to warm and/or dry river valleys, discontinuities in elevation, and high peaks separating fauna from different range slopes. The most important barrier is the Marañon River Valley, which limits the boundaries of four bioregions and is congruent with eight phylogenetic distribution breaks, separating the Central and Northern Andes, where the most bioregions are found. We also show that many bioregions have diffuse and overlapping structures, with contact and transition zones that challenge previous conceptions of biogeographical regions as spatially simple in structure. This study found evidence that the drivers of our identified bioregions were processes of Andean uplift and mountain dispersal facilitated by temperature oscillations of the Pleistocene. Therefore, Andean bioregions were not formed from one simple biogeographical event in a certain time frame, but from a combination of vicariance and dispersal events, which occurred in different time periods.},

Through detailed analysis of the past, we recount how malaria became a colonial problem, how malaria control rose to prominence as a colonial activity, and how interest in malaria was harnessed to create the first schools of tropical medicine and the academic specialization now known as global health. We discuss how these historical experiences shape malaria policy around the world today. The objective of this paper is to advance discussion about how malaria and other aspects of global health could be decolonized, and to suggest directions for future analysis that can lead to concrete steps for action.},

Recent developments in telemetry and genomics, when combined, can bring significant insights on the migratory ecology of nonmodel organisms in the wild. Here, we used this integrative approach to document dispersal, gene flow and potential for local adaptation in anadromous Arctic Char from six rivers in the Canadian Arctic. Acoustic telemetry data from 124 tracked individuals indicated asymmetric dispersal, with a large proportion of fish (72\%) tagged in three different rivers migrating up the same short river in the fall. Population genomics data from 6,136 SNP markers revealed weak, albeit significant, population differentiation (average pairwise FST = 0.011) and asymmetric dispersal was also revealed by population assignments. Approximate Bayesian computation simulations suggested the presence of asymmetric gene flow, although in the opposite direction to that observed from the telemetry data, suggesting that dispersal does not necessarily lead to gene flow. These observations suggested that Arctic Char home to their natal river to spawn, but may overwinter in rivers with the shortest migratory route to minimize the costs of migration in nonbreeding years. Genome scans and genetic–environment associations identified 90 outlier markers putatively under selection, 23 of which were in or near a gene. Of these, at least four were involved in muscle and cardiac function, consistent with the hypothesis that migratory harshness could drive local adaptation. Our study illustrates the power of integrating genomics and telemetry to study migrations in nonmodel organisms in logistically challenging environments such as the Arctic.},

These movements are relatively well understood at a population level, but how individual insects achieve them remains elusive. Behavioral responses to conditions en route are little studied, primarily owing to the challenges of tracking individual insects. Using a light aircraft and individual radio tracking, we show that nocturnally migrating death’s-head hawkmoths maintain control of their flight trajectories over long distances. The moths did not just fly with favorable tailwinds; during a given night, they also adjusted for head and crosswinds to precisely hold course. This behavior indicates that the moths use a sophisticated internal compass to maintain seasonally beneficial migratory trajectories independent of wind conditions, illuminating how insects traverse long distances to take advantage of seasonal resources.

	abstract = {Significance
            There has been an impassioned debate in recent years about whether biodiversity is negatively or positively correlated to wildlife and zoonotic disease transmission and risk, suggesting a “dilution” or “amplification” effect, respectively. Here, we demonstrate for an important zoonotic disease (hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) that species diversity can act differently on competing drivers of disease transmission (host density, contact rates, transmissibility) and may cause increases and decreases in transmission, concurrently in the same host–pathogen system. The net effect (dilution, amplification, or no effect) is determined by the strength of the competing mechanisms. Therefore, to move forward, researchers should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms separately and their net effects if we want to make generalizable predictions across systems.
          , 
            
              In this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and increased zoonotic disease emergence, it is imperative to understand the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic pathogen dynamics in wildlife. Whether increasing biodiversity should lead to a decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an

              35\% mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse, in areas with higher small mammal diversity—a dilution effect. However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher diversity—a component amplification effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same host–pathogen system; there is a component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate), but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on reservoir host population density is stronger. These results suggest we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if we want to make generalizable predictions across host–pathogen systems.},

Using a stage-structured host-pathogen model parameterized and crossvalidated from a unique 15-year data set, we show how stochastic population fluctuations can lead to predictable dynamics of SNV in deer mice. Significant variation in host abundance and the basic reproductive number of the virus results in intermittent crossing of the critical host population density necessary for SNV endemicity and frequent local extinctions. When environmental conditions favor growth of the host population above the threshold, hostpathogen interactions lead to delayed density dependence in reservoir prevalence. The resultant ecological delay may provide a neglected opportunity for outbreak prediction in zoonoses.

Studies with allozymes in the 1970s provided the ﬁrst estimates of the amount of genetic variation within and between natural populations at multiple loci. These early studies played an important role in developing plans to conserve species. The description of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA in the early 1980s laid the foundation for the ﬁeld of phylogeography, which provided a deeper look in time of the relationships and connectivity among populations. The development of microsatellites in the 1990s provided much more powerful means to describe genetic variation at nuclear loci, including the ability to detect past bottlenecks and estimate current effective population size with a single temporal sample. In the 2000s, single nucleotide polymorphisms presented a cornucopia of loci that has greatly improved power to estimate genetic and population demographic parameters important for conservation. Today, population genomics presents the ability to detect regions of the genome that are affected by natural selection (e.g. local adaptation or inbreeding depression). In addition, the ability to genotype historical samples has provided power to understand how climate change and other anthropogenic phenomena have affected populations. Modern molecular techniques provide unprecedented power to understand genetic variation in natural populations. Nevertheless, application of this information requires sound understanding of population genetics theory. I believe that current training in conservation genetics focuses too much on the latest techniques and too little on understanding the conceptual basis which is needed to interpret these data and ask good questions.},

Justus von Liebig’s law of the minimum has played a useful role in focusing attention on biogeochemical regulation of populations, but given that ∼251 elements are required to build organisms and that these organisms use and deplete nutrients in aggregates of communities and ecosystems, we make the case that it is time to move on. We review available models that suggest the many different mechanisms that give rise to multiple elements, or colimitation. We then review recent empirical data that show that rates of decomposition and primary productivity may be limited by multiple elements. In that light, given the tropics’ high species diversity and generally more weathered soils, we predict that colimitation at community and ecosystem scales is more prevalent closer to the equator. We conclude with suggestions for how to move forward with experimental studies of colimitation.},

              Life histories of species may be shaped by nutritional limitations posed on populations. Yet, populations contain individuals that differ according to sex and life stage, each of which having different nutritional demands and experiencing specific limitations. We studied patterns of resource assimilation, allocation and excretion during the growth of the solitary bee
              Osmia bicornis
              (two sexes) under natural conditions. Adopting an ecological perspective, we assert that organisms ingest mutable organic molecules that are transformed during physiological processes and that the immutable atoms of the chemical elements composing these molecules may be allocated to specific functions, thereby influencing organismal fitness and life history. Therefore, using the framework of ecological stoichiometry, we investigated the multielemental (C, N, S, P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu) compositions of six components of the bee elemental budget: food (pollen), eggs, pupae, adults, cocoons and excreta. The sexes differed fundamentally in the assimilation and allocation of acquired atoms, elemental phenotypes, and stoichiometric niches for all six components. Phosphorus, which supports larval growth, was allocated mainly (55–75\%) to the cocoon after larval development was complete. Additionally, the majority (60–99\%) of the Mn, Ca, Mg and Zn acquired during larval development was allocated to the cocoon, probably influencing bee fitness by conferring protection. We conclude that for holometabolous insects, considering only the chemical composition of the adult body within the context of nutritional ecology does not provide a complete picture. Low ratios of C to other nutrients, low N:P and high Na concentrations in excreta and cocoons may be important for local-scale nutrient cycling. Limited access to specific nutritional elements may hinder bee development in a sex-dependent manner, and N and P limitations, commonly considered elsewhere, may not play important roles in
              O. bicornis
              . Sexual dimorphism in nutritional limitations due to nutrient scarcity during the larval stage may influence bee population function and should be considered in bee conservation efforts.},

The use of ionomics and ecological stoichiometry enables consideration that changes in the environmental nutritional supply affect the ecophysi­ ology, behavior, health and fitness of individuals, influencing their ecological interactions and population functioning. The resulting knowledge can help promote better conservation and restoration strategies. Ulti­ mately, ionomics and ecological stoichiometry facilitate improved forecasting and mitigation of the negative effects of current global change. Here, we present the theoretical background followed by the application of ionomics and ecological stoichiometry in biological conservation. We also propose avenues for future research. For example, larval and adult pollinating insects belong to different feeding guilds, and larvae rely on various stoichiometrically (im)balanced foods (showing herbivory, pollinivory, detritivory or even carnivory). Therefore, the ecology and diversity of pollinators may be shaped by the nutritional quality of larval food, which is required for physiological development into fully functional adults. Although a stoichiometric balance during larval development is crucial for pollinator health and fitness, pollinator conservation is focused on the nutritional needs of adults. Another example is atmospheric CO2 increases leading to nutrient dilution in plant tissues, aggravating nutritional imbalances in consumers and challenging Earth's herbivore populations. CO2-driven nutrient dilution may affect food webs, ecosystems and human wellbeing. However, our understanding of this phenomenon is minimal. These and other unresolved conservation biology problems may be studied and solved using ionomics and ecological stoichiometry.},

These alterations are predicted to continue to increase, with the potential for a wide range of impacts on invertebrates, key players in ecosystem-level processes. Here, we present a meta-analysis of 1679 cases from 207 studies reporting the effects of N, P, and combined N + P enrichment on the abundance, biomass, and richness of aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates. Nitrogen and phosphorus additions decreased invertebrate abundance in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, with stronger impacts under combined N + P additions. Likewise, N and N + P additions had stronger negative impacts on the abundance of tropical than temperate invertebrates. Overall, the effects of nutrient enrichment did not differ signiﬁcantly among major invertebrate taxonomic groups, suggesting that changes in biogeochemical cycles are a pervasive threat to invertebrate populations across ecosystems. The effects of N and P additions differed signiﬁcantly among invertebrate trophic groups but N + P addition had a consistent negative effect on invertebrates. Nutrient additions had weaker or inconclusive impacts on invertebrate biomass and richness, possibly due to the low number of case studies for these community responses. Our ﬁndings suggest that N and P enrichment affect invertebrate community structure mainly by decreasing invertebrate abundance, and these effects are dependent on the habitat and trophic identity of the invertebrates. These results highlight the important effects of human-driven nutrient enrichment on ecological systems and suggest a potential driver for the global invertebrate decline documented in recent years.},

Additionally, when considering long-term trends driven by climate, one must account for large-scale oscillations including El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We combine long-term datasets of grasshopper abundance, climate, plant biomass, and end-of-season foliar elemental content to examine potential drivers of abundance cycles and trends of this dominant herbivore. Annual grasshopper abundances in 16- and 22-y time series from a Kansas prairie revealed both 5-y cycles and declines of 2.1–2.7\%/y. Climate cycle indices of spring ENSO, summer NAO, and winter or spring PDO accounted for 40–54\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance, mediated by effects of weather and host plants. Consistent with ND, grass biomass doubled and foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na—nutrients which limit grasshopper abundance—declined over the same period. The decline in plant nutrients accounted for 25\% of the variation in grasshopper abundance over two decades. Thus a warming, wetter, more CO

	abstract = {The relationship between plant nutrient content and insect herbivore populations and community structure has long interested ecologists. Insect herbivores require multiple nutrients, but ecologists have focused mostly on nitrogen (an estimate of plant protein content), and more recently phosphorus (P); other nutrients have received little attention. Here we document nutrient variation in grass and forb samples from grassland habitats in central Nebraska using an elemental approach; in total we measured foliar concentrations of 12 elements (N and P, plus S, B, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu). We detected significant variability among sites for N, P, Mg, Na, K, and Cu. We next used a model selection approach to explore how this nutritional variation and plant biomass correlate with grasshopper densities (collectively and at the feeding-guild level), and principal component analysis to explore nutrient correlations with grasshopper community species composition. When all grasshoppers were pooled, densities varied among sites, but only P was associated with abundance of the elements shown to vary between sites. Different responses occurred at the feeding-guild level. For grass specialists, densities were associated with N, plus P, Mg, and Na. For forb specialists, N and P were often associated with density, but associations with Na and K were also observed. Finally, mixed-feeder abundance was strongly associated with biomass, and to a lesser extent P, Mg, Na, and Cu. At the community level, B, Ca, Zn, and Cu, plus biomass, explained {\textgreater}30\% of species composition variation. Our results confirm the positive association of N and P with insect herbivore populations, while suggesting a potential role for Mg, Na, and K. They also demonstrate the importance of exploring effects at the feeding-guild level. We hope our data motivate ecologists to think beyond N and P when considering plant nutrient effects on insect herbivores, and make a call for studies to examine functional responses of insect herbivores to dietary manipulation of Mg, Na, and K. Finally, our results demonstrate correlations between variation in nutrients and species assemblages, but factors not linked to plant nutrient quality or biomass likely explain most of the observed variation.},

The results show there are differences in macro and micronutrient levels between the reproductive females and workers during development. Gynes showed changes in nutrient levels during their lifetime especially as they changed roles from a solitary individual to a nesting queen. Males also showed distinct nutritional changes during their lifetime. The implications for these nutritional differences are discussed.},

I propose that sodium also plays a central, though unheralded role in herbivore digestion, via its importance to maintaining microbiomes and denaturing tannins. I highlight how sodium availability is a key determinant of consumer abundance and the geography of herbivory and detritivory. And I propose a re-appraisal of the assumption that, because sodium is metabolically unimportant to most plants, it is of little use. Instead, I suggest that sodium’s critical role in limiting herbivore performance makes it a commodity used by plants to manipulate their herbivores and mutualists, and by consumers like bison and elephants to generate grazing lawns: dependable sources of sodium.},

Compared to nectar, honey contained 40-fold lower Fe, 26-fold lower Zn, and eightfold lower Cu and Cd levels, indicating removal of these elements via nectar processing, during which water is evaporated and complex sugars are decomposed into simple ones. The amount of Pb remained unchanged; however, it can also be regarded as a fourfold decrease due to water evaporation from honey, compared to nectar. Some portion of the ingested Fe, Cu, and Zn was used by bees, and the excess amounts were excreted in feces. All analyzed elements were present as biocomplexes transported from the alimentary tract through the abdomen to the thorax and head. Elements transferred in the alimentary tract were partially immobilized/metabolized in the bee fat body, and their residues were excreted with feces from the gut.

	abstract = {Biologists seek to understand why organisms vary in their abilities to tolerate anthropogenic contaminants, such as heavy metals. However, few studies have considered how tolerance may be affected by condition‐moderating factors such as dietary resource availability. For instance, the availability of crucial limiting macronutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous, can vary across space and time either naturally or due to anthropogenic nutrient inputs (e.g., agricultural fertilizers or vehicle emissions). Organisms developing in more macronutrient‐rich environments should be of higher overall condition, displaying a greater ability to tolerate metal contaminants. In monarch butterﬂies (Danaus plexippus), we factorially manipulated dietary macronutrient availability and exposure to zinc, a common metal contaminant in urban habitats that can be toxic but also has nutritional properties. We tested whether (1) the ability to survive zinc exposure depends on dietary macronutrient availability and (2) whether individuals exposed to elevated zinc levels display higher expression of antioxidant genes, given the roles of antioxidants in combatting metal‐induced oxidative stress. Exposure to elevated zinc reduced survival only for monarchs developing on a low‐macronutrient diet. However, for monarchs developing on a highmacronutrient diet, elevated zinc exposure tended to increase survival. In addition, monarchs exposed to elevated zinc displayed higher expression of antioxidant genes when developing on the low‐macronutrient diet but lower expression when developing on the high‐macronutrient diet. Altogether, our study shows that organismal survival and oxidative stress responses to anthropogenic zinc contamination depend on the availability of macronutrient resources in the developmental environment. In addition, our results suggest the hypothesis that whether zinc acts as a toxicant or a nutrient may depend on macronutrient supply. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;41:1286–2961. © 2022 The Authors.

            Seasonal environmental fluctuations provide formidable challenges for living organisms, especially small ectotherms such as butterflies. A common strategy to cope with harsh environments is to enter diapause, but some species avoid the unsuitable conditions by migrating. Despite a growing understanding of migration in the life cycles of some butterfly species, it is unknown how individuals register and store environmental cues to determine whether and where to migrate. Here, we explored how competition and host plant availability during larval development affect patterns of DNA methylation in the migratory painted lady (
            Vanessa cardui
            ) butterfly. We identify a set of potentially functional methylome shifts associated with differences in the environment, indicating that DNA methylation is involved in the response to different conditions during larval development. By analysing the transcriptome for the same samples used for methylation profiling, we also uncovered a non-linear relationship between gene body methylation and gene expression. Our results provide a starting point for understanding the interplay between DNA methylation and gene expression in butterflies in general and how differences in environmental conditions during development can trigger unique epigenetic marks that might be important for behavioural decisions in the adult stage.},

	abstract = {Research hypotheses have been a cornerstone of science since before Galileo. Many have argued that hypotheses (1) encourage discovery of mechanisms, and (2) reduce bias—­both features that should increase transferability and reproducibility. However, we are entering a new era of big data and highly predictive models where some argue the hypothesis is outmoded. We hypothesized that hypothesis use has declined in ecology and evolution since the 1990s, given the substantial advancement of tools further facilitating descriptive, correlative research. Alternatively, hypothesis use may have become more frequent due to the strong recommendation by some journals and funding agencies that submissions have hypothesis statements. Using a detailed literature analysis (N = 268 articles), we found prevalence of hypotheses in eco–­evo research is very low (6.7\%–­26\%) and static from 1990–­2015, a pattern mirrored in an extensive literature search (N = 302,558 articles). Our literature review also indicates that neither grant success nor citation rates were related to the inclusion of hypotheses, which may provide disincentive for hypothesis formulation. Here, we review common justifications for avoiding hypotheses and present new arguments based on benefits to the individual researcher. We argue that stating multiple alternative hypotheses increases research clarity and precision, and is more likely to address the mechanisms for observed patterns in nature. Although hypotheses are not always necessary, we expect their continued and increased use will help our fields move toward greater understanding, reproducibility, prediction, and effective conservation of nature.},

              During recent decades, pathogens that originated in bats have become an increasing public health concern. A major challenge is to identify how those pathogens spill over into human populations to generate a pandemic threat
              1
              . Many correlational studies associate spillover with changes in land use or other anthropogenic stressors

              4
              . One limitation is the lack of spatially and temporally explicit data on multiple spillovers, and on the connections among spillovers, reservoir host ecology and behaviour and viral dynamics. We present 25 years of data on land-use change, bat behaviour and spillover of Hendra virus from Pteropodid bats to horses in subtropical Australia. These data show that bats are responding to environmental change by persistently adopting behaviours that were previously transient responses to nutritional stress. Interactions between land-use change and climate now lead to persistent bat residency in agricultural areas, where periodic food shortages drive clusters of spillovers. Pulses of winter flowering of trees in remnant forests appeared to prevent spillover. We developed integrative Bayesian network models based on these phenomena that accurately predicted the presence or absence of clusters of spillovers in each of the 25 years. Our long-term study identifies the mechanistic connections between habitat loss, climate and increased spillover risk. It provides a framework for examining causes of bat virus spillover and for developing ecological countermeasures to prevent pandemics.},

	abstract = {Background: Hormesis is a biphasic biological response characterized by the stimulatory effect at relatively low amounts of chemical compounds which are otherwise detrimental at higher concentrations. A hormetic response in larval growth rates has been observed in cotton-feeding insects in response to increasing concentrations of gossypol, a toxic metabolite found in the pigment glands of some plants in the family Malvaceae. We investigated the developmental effect of gossypol in the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, an important heliothine pest species, by exposing larvae to different doses of this metabolite in their diet. In addition, we sought to determine the underlying transcriptional responses to different gossypol doses.
Results: Larval weight gain, pupal weight and larval development time were measured in feeding experiments and a hormetic response was seen for the first two characters. On the basis of net larval weight gain responses to gossypol, three concentrations (0\%, 0.016\% and 0.16\%) were selected for transcript profiling in the gut and the rest of the body in a two-color double reference design microarray experiment. Hormesis could be observed at the transcript level, since at the low gossypol dose, genes involved in energy acquisition such as b-fructofuranosidases were up-regulated in the gut, and genes involved in cell adhesion were down-regulated in the body. Genes with products predicted to be integral to the membrane or associated with the proteasome core complex were significantly affected by the detrimental dose treatment in the body. Oxidoreductase activity-related genes were observed to be significantly altered in both tissues at the highest gossypol dose.
Conclusions: This study represents the first transcriptional profiling approach investigating the effects of different concentrations of gossypol in a lepidopteran species. H. armigera’s transcriptional response to gossypol feeding is tissue- and dose-dependent and involves diverse detoxifying mechanisms not only to alleviate direct effects of gossypol but also indirect damage such as pH disturbance and oxygen radical formation. Genes discovered through this transcriptional approach may be additional candidates for understanding gossypol detoxification and coping with gossypol-induced stress. In a generalist herbivore that has evolved transcriptionally-regulated responses to a variety of different plant compounds, hormesis may be due to a lower induction threshold of growth-promoting, stress-coping responses and a higher induction threshold of detoxification pathways that are costly and cause collateral damage to the cell.},

	abstract = {Generalist insect herbivores, those recorded as using numerous hosts (tens or even hundreds of species), are not well understood ecologically. We suggest ways to investigate the ecology of these species beyond the practice of accumulating host records. We present reasons why multiple host use by herbivorous insects needs to be quantified in the field, both locally and geographically, and also through time. Further, the host use patterns generated must be based on certain knowledge that cryptic species are not conflated in the results as one species. Such results reveal a lot about the ecology of the species concerned and about generalist–host relationships more widely. This provides a sound basis for the functional significance of multiple host use to be interpreted and tested further. Structured sampling programs conducted previously in the field indicate that generalist insect herbivores are strongly associated with only a relatively small subset of their recorded host species, their primary host plants. A focus on these particular host plants is fundamental to (i) understanding the ecology of the herbivore species in question and (ii) investigating the sensory and behavioural mechanisms associated with host location. We conclude that the principal influence on patterns of multiple host use in the field is the mechanism by which herbivorous insects recognise cues from potential hosts and use them to localise plants. These mechanisms represent speciesspecific and species-wide adaptations to the usual environment of the species in question. Working from this perspective should contribute substantially to developing a strong and realistic interpretation of the origins and functional significance of multiple host use in herbivorous arthropods.},

However, the dispersal process is multi-causal, which currently hinders predictions regarding a species’ resilience to global change. We used a multifaceted approach to disentangle the relative importance of a suite of dispersalrelated factors in the butterﬂy Lycaena tityrus, including condition- (morphology and behavior) and context- (environmental) dependent factors. Experiments were conducted at an experimental platform dedicated to study dispersal, the Metatron, to record emigration propensity in two-patch experimental metapopulations under different environmental conditions. The butterﬂies’ individual condition was subsequently assessed in the laboratory. Individual condition did not generally inﬂuence emigration propensity. We detected a signiﬁcant sex bias in emigration propensity, being generally higher in females than in males, but in a context-dependent manner. The environmental context affected emigration propensity, which was higher when habitat quality was poor. Our results show that emigration is not random in L. tityrus, but is rather an active process triggered by sex and habitat quality. Our main ﬁnding was that individual condition, and particularly ﬂight ability measured by a performance test, was not related to emigration propensity in experimental metapopulations. Our results may have important implications for forecasting future species distributions, as deteriorating environmental contexts are likely to increase emigration whatever the individual condition is.},

However, how such suites of phenotypic traits emerge and are maintained is largely unknown, although deciphering the processes shaping the evolution of dispersal phenotypes is a key in ecology and evolution. In this study, we created artificial populations of a butterfly, in which we controlled for individual phenotypes and measured experimentally the roles of selection and genetic constraints on the correlations between dispersal-related traits: flight performance and wing morphology. We demonstrate that (i) trait covariations are not due to genetic correlations, (ii) the effects of selection are sex-specific, and (iii) both divergent and stabilizing selection maintain specific flight performance phenotypes and wing morphologies. Interestingly, some trait combinations are also favoured, depending on sex and fitness components. Moreover, we provide evidence for the role of (dis)assortative mating in the evolution of these dispersal-related traits. Our results suggest that dispersal syndromes may have high evolutionary potential, but also that they may be easily disrupted under particular environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {While recombination is widely recognized to be a key modulator of numerous evolutionary phenomena, we have a poor understanding of how recombination rate itself varies and evolves within a species. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of recombination rate (rate of meiotic crossing over) in two natural populations of Drosophila pseudoobscura from Utah and Arizona, USA. We used an amplicon sequencing approach to obtain high-quality genotypes in approximately 8,000 individual backcrossed offspring (17 mapping populations with roughly 530 individuals each), for which we then quantiﬁed crossovers. Interestingly, variation in recombination rate within and between populations largely manifested as differences in genome-wide recombination rate rather than remodeling of the local recombination landscape. Comparing populations, we discovered individuals from the Utah population displayed on average 8\% higher crossover rates than the Arizona population, a statistically significant difference. Using a QST-FST analysis, we found that this difference in crossover rate was dramatically higher than expected under neutrality, indicating that this difference may have been driven by natural selection. Finally, using a combination of short- and longread whole-genome sequencing, we found no signiﬁcant association between crossover rate and structural variation at the 200–400 kb scale. Our results demonstrate that (1) there is abundant variation in genomewide crossover rate in natural populations, (2) at the 200–400 kb scale, recombination rate appears to vary largely genome-wide, rather than in speciﬁc intervals, and (3) interpopulation differences in recombination rate may be the result of local adaptation.},

	abstract = {Insect physiology is affected by the presence of toxins in the surrounding environment of insects as well as their food sources. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of heavy metal exposure to two low concentrations (50 μg/g and 150 μg/g) of lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) through artificial diet to the larvae on biological parameters of Asian armyworm (Spodoptera litura Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Both Pb and Zn, even at low concentrations, had relatively high toxic effects on S. litura larvae (P {\textless} 0.01). S. litura larval weight and length suffered the maximum reduction when the larvae were fed on diet mixed with the high Pb concentration (150 μg/g) tested compared to the other treatments. At the same Pb concentration (150 μg/g), values of larva growth index, pupa growth index, immature growth index, standardized growth index, and fitness index were 4.66, 7.33, 7.82, 5.35, and 10.00 times lower, respectively, than those of control. At the same Zn concentration (150 μg/g), values of larval growth index, pupal growth index, immature growth index, standardized growth index, and fitness index were 5.61, 3.00, 3.04, 3.23, and 9.24 times lower, respectively, than those of control. The survival rate of S. litura larvae was also lower (12.5\%) when the larvae were fed on diet mixed with Pb at 150 μg/g after 10 days of observation. Overall, the presence of those heavy metals in the environment, even at low concentrations, would exert an adverse impact on larvae development of this insect. From this point of view, findings could provide a basis for long-term evaluation of heavy metal risk and its impact on populations of important agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Recombination reshufﬂes the alleles of a population through crossover and gene conversion. These mechanisms have considerable consequences on the evolution and maintenance of genetic diversity. Crossover, for example, can increase genetic diversity by breaking the linkage between selected and nearby neutral variants. Bias in favor of G or C alleles during gene conversion may instead promote the ﬁxation of one allele over the other, thus decreasing diversity. Mutation bias from G or C to A and T opposes GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC). Less recognized is that these two processes may—when balanced—promote genetic diversity. Here, we investigate how gBGC and mutation bias shape genetic diversity patterns in wood white butterﬂies (Leptidea sp.). This constitutes the ﬁrst in-depth investigation of gBGC in butterﬂies. Using 60 resequenced genomes from six populations of three species, we ﬁnd substantial variation in the strength of gBGC across lineages. When modeling the balance of gBGC and mutation bias and comparing analytical results with empirical data, we reject gBGC as the main determinant of genetic diversity in these butterﬂy species. As alternatives, we consider linked selection and GC content. We ﬁnd evidence that high values of both reduce diversity. We also show that the joint effects of gBGC and mutation bias can give rise to a diversity pattern which resembles the signature of linked selection. Consequently, gBGC should be considered when interpreting the effects of linked selection on levels of genetic diversity.},

This migration phenomena can be affected by climate change, which may have important implications on fitness and ultimately populations status. We investigated the long-­term trends in fall migration phenology of monarchs using a 25-­year dataset collected along the coast of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. We also investigated local long-­term trends in weather covariates that have the potential to influence migration phenology at this site. Patterns in standardized daily counts of monarchs were compared with local weather covariates using two methods (i.e., monthly averages and moving windows) to assess difference in outputs between analytical approaches. Our results suggest that monarch migration timing (migration midpoint, average peak, first peak, and late passage) and weather covariates have been consistent over time, in direct contrast to a similar study in Cape May, New Jersey, which showed a significant increase in both fall temperature and a 16-­to 19-­day shift in monarch migration timing. Furthermore, our results differed between analytical approaches. With respect to annual variability in air temperature, our monthly average analysis suggested that for each degree increase in September air temperature, late season passage would advance 4.71 days (±1.59 SE, p = .01). However, the moving window analysis suggested that this result is likely spurious and found no significant correlations between migration timing and any weather covariates. Importantly, our results caution against extrapolating the effects of climate change on the migration phenology of the monarch across study regions and the need for more long-­term monitoring efforts to better understand regional drivers of variability in migration timing.},

	abstract = {The clouded apollo (Parnassius mnemosyne) used to have a wide distribution in Fennoscandia. Recent population declines have, however, led to regional extinctions and in Sweden it is currently one of the most endangered butterflies, confined to three geographically separated metapopulations: Blekinge, Roslagen and Västernorrland. Especially the Blekinge population has declined dramatically and few imagines have been observed during recent census efforts ({\textless} 10 in some localities). The clouded apollo is subject to a species action plan which includes both habitat restorations and captive breeding to produce individuals for release and reintroductions. Here, we apply whole-genome resequencing of clouded apollo individuals collected in the three natural populations and the captive population in Sweden and apply population genomic approaches to get a better understanding of the genetic structure and levels of genetic diversity in the species. We find that the clouded apollo populations in the different geographic regions have similar, but comparatively low levels of genetic diversity and we find evidence for significant genetic differentiation between the northernmost population and the populations in southern Sweden. Additional analysis, including previously available mitochondrial data, unveil that a bi-directional re-colonization of Fennoscandia after the latest glacial maximum most likely is the explanation for the considerable differentiation between some Swedish populations. Finally, we find evidence for population sub-structure in one of the Swedish populations. The results provide insights into the genetic consequences of population size declines and fragmentation in general and provide important information for direct conservation actions for the clouded apollo in Sweden in particular.},

	abstract = {Genetic recombination is a key molecular mechanism that has profound implications on both micro- and macro-evolutionary processes. However, the determinants of recombination rate variation in holocentric organisms are poorly understood, in particular in Lepidoptera (moths and butterﬂies). The wood white butterﬂy (Leptidea sinapis) shows considerable intraspeciﬁc variation in chromosome numbers and is a suitable system for studying regional recombination rate variation and its potential molecular underpinnings. Here, we developed a large wholegenome resequencing data set from a population of wood whites to obtain high-resolution recombination maps using linkage disequilibrium information. The analyses revealed that larger chromosomes had a bimodal recombination landscape, potentially due to interference between simultaneous chiasmata. The recombination rate was signiﬁcantly lower in subtelomeric regions, with exceptions associated with segregating chromosome rearrangements, showing that ﬁssions and fusions can have considerable effects on the recombination landscape. There was no association between the inferred recombination rate and base composition, supporting a negligible inﬂuence of GC-biased gene conversion in butterﬂies. We found signiﬁcant but variable associations between the recombination rate and the density of different classes of transposable elements (TEs), most notably a signiﬁcant enrichment of SINEs in genomic regions with higher recombination rate. Finally, the analyses unveiled signiﬁcant enrichment of genes involved in farnesyltranstransferase activity in recombination cold-spots, potentially indicating that expression of transferases can inhibit formation of chiasmata during meiotic division. Our results provide novel information about recombination rate variation in holocentric organisms and has particular implications for forthcoming research in population genetics, molecular/genome evolution and speciation.},

To elucidate a process of butterfly color-pattern evolution and speciation in the light of this hypothesis, morphological and physiological differences between a pair of sister species, the Painted Lady butterfly Vanessa cardui and the Australian Painted Lady butterfly Vanessa kershawi, were investigated. Ten different traits of wing color-pattern were indicated, most of which concerned the darker coloration of V. kershawi, with the notable exception of the blue foci at the center of the black focal elements only in V. kershawi. Differences in behavior and life history between the two species appeared to be minimal, but importantly, V. kershawi tends to prefer a “stressful” arid environment. The experimental treatment of pupae of V. cardui either by low temperature or by injection of thapsigargin, a stress-inducing chemical, readily produced individuals with the darker coloration and the blue foci as a result of a general stress response. These stress-induced color-pattern modifications were considered to be the revelation of phenotypic plasticity in V. cardui. Taken together, I propose that the ancestral species of V. kershawi had similar phenotypic plasticity. Natural selection exploited this plasticity and shaped the present V. kershawi as an independent species, whose specific color-pattern traits are by-products of this adaptation process.},

Previous research has highlighted stepwise expansion across the Pacific, though questions remain about expansion timing and the population genetic consequences of migration loss. Here, we present reduced-­representation sequencing data for 275 monarchs from North America (n = 85), 12 Pacific Islands (n = 136) and three locations in Australia (n = 54), with the goal of understanding (i) how the monarch's Pacific expansion has shaped patterns of population genetic variation and (ii) how loss of migration has influenced spatial patterns of differentiation. We find support for previously described stepwise dispersal across the Pacific and document an additional expansion from Hawaii into the Mariana Islands. Nonmigratory monarchs within the Mariana Islands show strong patterns of differentiation, despite their proximity; by contrast, migratory North American samples form a single genetically panmictic population across the continent. Estimates of Pacific establishment timing are highly uncertain ({\textasciitilde}100–­1,000,000 years ago) but overlap with historical records that indicate a recent expansion. Our data support (i) a recent expansion across the Pacific whose timing overlaps with available historical records of establishment and (ii) a strong role for seasonal migration in determining patterns of spatial genetic variation. Our results are noteworthy because they demonstrate how the evolution of partial migration can drive population differentiation over contemporary timescales.},

            The restoration of forest structure and function is increasingly being used in boreal forests in order to halt the loss of biodiversity. Often ecological restoration is aimed at increasing the volume of dead and dying trees to enhance the biodiversity of deadwood-dependent organisms, but it may also increase population sizes of pest bark beetle species, even several years following restoration. Herein, we used a large-scale restoration experiment in Northern Sweden to assess the 5 years post-restoration effects of restorative gap cutting and prescribed burning on the populations of a set of economically harmful pest bark beetles (Ips typographus, Polygraphus poligraphus, Tomicus piniperda and Pityogenes chalcographus) and the most important predators of bark beetles, Thanasimus spp. In addition, we assessed the effects of forest stand characteristics at stand and landscape scale on the abundance of I. typographus. Five years post-restoration, gap-cut stands supported the highest abundances of P. poligraphus and contained the highest count of spruce trees newly attacked by bark beetles. By contrast, prescribed burning generally sustained the lowest abundances of pest bark beetles, especially I. typographus and P. poligraphus, and the highest abundance of their natural predators Thanasimus spp. The population abundance of I. typographus was also positively affected by the area of clear cuts within a 500 m radius from the stand. In conclusion, prescribed burning appears to be a safer method for ecological restoration than gap cutting in the long-term. According to our results, a risk of a local bark beetle outbreak still remains 5 years following the initiation of ecological restoration treatments on spruce-dominated mature gap-cut stands.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of biodiversity, including the spatial distribution of genetic diversity, is critical for predicting responses to environmental changes, as well as for effective conservation measures. This task requires tracking changes in biodiversity at large spatial scales and correlating with species functional traits. We provide three comprehensive resources to understand the determinants for mitochondrial DNA differentiation represented by (a) 15,609 COI sequences and (b) 14 traits belonging to 307 butterfly species occurring in Western‐Central Europe and (c) the first multi‐locus phylogenetic tree of all European butterfly species. By applying phylogenetic regressions we show that mitochondrial DNA spatial differentiation (as measured with GST, G′ST, D and DST) is negatively correlated with species traits determining dispersal capability and colonization ability. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of the COI data, we also provide the first zoogeographic regionalization maps based on intraspecific genetic variation. The overall pattern obtained by averaging the spatial differentiation of all Western‐Central European butterflies shows that the paradigm of long‐term glacial isolation followed by rapid pulses of post‐glacial expansion has been a pervasive phenomenon in European butterflies. The results and the extensive data sets we provide here constitute the basis for genetically‐informed conservation plans for a charismatic group in a continent where flying insects are under alarming decline.},

We argue that the influence of the isotopic contribution of adult diet is generally small and is likely minimal if the wings are carefully sampled to avoid veins. However, we also demonstrated that wings are not inert tissues, and that adult feeding contributes to some of the intra-population

              H geolocation using insect wings remains valid, but that adult feeding, butterfly age and wing vein sampling generate an inherent uncertainty limiting the precision of geolocation.},

              Migratory routes and remote wintering quarters in birds are often species and even population specific. It has been known for decades that songbirds mainly migrate solitarily, and that the migration direction is genetically controlled. Yet, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain unknown. To investigate the genetic basis of migration direction, we track genotyped willow warblers
              Phylloscopus trochilus
              from a migratory divide in Sweden, where South-West migrating, and South-East migrating subspecies form a hybrid swarm. We find evidence that migration direction follows a dominant inheritance pattern with epistatic interaction between two loci explaining 74\% of variation. Consequently, most hybrids migrate similarly to one of the parental subspecies, and therefore do not suffer from the cost of following an inferior, intermediate route. This has significant implications for understanding the selection processes that maintain narrow migratory divides.},

              Chinook salmon are known to return to spawn at two distinct times of the year: spring and fall. Individuals that return during these times have generally been referred to as parts of distinct groups, or ecotypes, with traits specific to their timing and presumed divergence being caused by the lack of interbreeding. By looking at genomes across fish from both runs, Thompson
              et al.
              found that a single genomic region of interest was nearly perfectly associated with run timing but not with other traits such as maturity and fat reserves (see the Perspective by McKinney). Further, they conclude that the region operates as a Mendelian trait, with assortment dictating run timing and associated phenotypes being caused by the migration environment rather than genetics.

            Differentiation between ecotypes is usually presumed to be complex and polygenic. Seasonal patterns of life history in salmon are used to categorize them into ecotypes, which are often considered “distinct” animals. Using whole-genome sequencing and tribal fishery sampling of Chinook salmon, we show that a single, small genomic region is nearly perfectly associated with spawning migration timing but not with adiposity or sexual maturity, traits long perceived as central to salmon ecotypes. Distinct migration timing does not prevent interbreeding between ecotypes, which are the result of a simple, ancient polymorphism segregating within a diverse population. Our finding that a complex migratory phenotype results from a single gene region will facilitate conservation and restoration of this iconic fish.},

Consequently, the accumulation of damage on the wings over time can affect survival, especially for species that travel long distances. We examined the frequency of irreversible wing damage in the migratory butterfly Vanessa cardui to explore the effect of wing structure on wing damage frequency, as well as the mechanisms that might mitigate wing damage. An exceptionally high migration rate driven by high precipitation levels in their larval habitats in the winter of 2018–2019 provided us with an excellent opportunity to collect data on the frequency of naturally occurring wing damage associated with long-distance flights. Digital images of 135 individuals of V. cardui were collected and analyzed in Germany. The results show that the hindwings experienced a greater frequency of damage than the forewings. Moreover, forewings experienced more severe damage on the lateral margin, whereas hindwings experienced more damage on the trailing margin. The frequency of wing margin damage was higher in the painted lady butterfly than in the migrating monarch butterfly and in the butterfly Pontia occidentalis following artificially induced wing collisions. The results of this study could be used in future comparative studies of patterns of wing damage in butterflies and other insects. Additional studies are needed to clarify whether the strategies for coping with wing damage differ between migratory and nonmigratory species.},

Herein, we explored diet-mediated host plant effects on development and immune response of a generalist insect herbivore. Vanessa cardui (Nymphalidae) caterpillars were reared on leaves of three host plants that vary in secondary metabolites, Plantago lanceolata (Plantaginaceae), Taraxacum officinale (Asteraceae) and Tithonia diversifolia (Asteraceae). Insect development was evaluated by larval and pupal viabilities, survivorship, and development rate. Immune response was measured as phenoloxidase (PO) activity. Additionally, chemical profiles of the host plants were obtained by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) and the discriminant metabolites were determined using a metabolomic approach. Caterpillars reared on P. lanceolata exhibited the highest larval and pupal viabilities, as well as PO activity, and P. lanceolata leaves were chemically characterized by the presence of iridoid glycosides, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. Taraxacum officinale leaves were characterized mainly by the presence of phenylpropanoids, flavones O-glycoside and germacranolide-type sesquiterpene lactones; caterpillars reared on this host plant fully developed to the adult stage, however they exhibited lower larval and pupal viabilities compared to individuals reared on P. lanceolata. Conversely, caterpillars reared on T. diversifolia leaves, which contain phenylpropanoids, flavones and diverse furanoheliangolide-type sesquiterpene lactones, were not able to complete larval development and exhibited the lowest PO activity. These findings suggested that V. cardui have adapted to tolerate potentially toxic metabolites occurring in P. lanceolata (iridoid glycosides), however caterpillars were not able to cope with potentially detrimental metabolites occurring in T. diversifolia (furanoheliangolides). Therefore, we suggest that furanoheliangolide-type sesquiterpene lactones were responsible for the poor development and immune response observed for caterpillars reared on T. diversifolia.},

	abstract = {More than half of the proteome from mandibular glands in caterpillars is represented by chemosensory proteins. Based on sequence similarity, these proteins are putative transporters of ligands to gustatory receptors in sensory organs of insects. We sought to determine whether these proteins are inducible by comparing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the salivary (mandibular and labial) proteomes from caterpillars (Vanessa cardui) reared on different plants and artiﬁcial diet containing either bacteria or bacterial cell-walls. We included a treatment where the caterpillars were switched from feeding on artiﬁcial diet to plant material at some point in their development. Additionally, we evaluated the degree of overlap between the proteomes in the hemolymph-ﬁlled coelom and salivary glands of caterpillars reared on plant material. We found that the quality and quantity of the identiﬁed proteins differed clearly between hemolymph-ﬁlled coelome, labial and mandibular glands. Our results indicated that even after molting and two-day feeding on a new diet, protein production is affected by the previous food source used by the caterpillar. Candidate proteins involved in chemosensory perception by insects were detected: three chemosensory (CSPs) and two odorant-binding proteins (OBPs). Using the relative amounts of these proteins across tissues and treatments as criteria for their classiﬁcation, we detected hemolymph- and mandibular gland-speciﬁc CSPs and observed that their levels were affected by caterpillar diet. Moreover, we could compare the protein and transcript levels across tissues and treatment for at least one CSP and one OBP. Therefore, we have identiﬁed speciﬁc isoforms for testing the role of CSPs and OBPs in plant and pathogen recognition. We detected catalase, immune-related protein and serine proteases and their inhibitors in high relative levels in the mandibular glands in comparison to the labial glands. These ﬁndings suggest that the mandibular glands of caterpillars may play an important role protecting the caterpillar from oxidative stress, pathogens and aiding in digestion. Contamination with hemolymph proteins during dissection of salivary glands from caterpillars may occur but it is not substantial since the proteomes from hemolymph, mandibular and labial glands were easily discriminated from each other by principal component analysis of proteomic data.},

	abstract = {Outbreaking insects are often considered identical units despite recent work in behavioural ecology that shows repeatable differences can exist between individuals and can have important implications for individual fitness and population processes. However, although entomologists have neglected the hypothesis that differences between individuals can play an important role in the ecology of a species, it is not new. Wellington (1957. Can. J. Zool. 35: 293–323) suggested that consistent individual differences in behaviour may play a role in the population dynamics of Malacosoma (Hu¨bner, 1820) species (Lepidoptera: Lasiocampidae). We used a novel approach to determine if individual larval Malacosoma disstria Hu¨bner, 1820 exhibit distinct and repeatable behavioural traits. Second-instar caterpillars were placed on individual arenas for 1 h on 4 consecutive days, and the proportion of time spent walking, searching, quiescent, and eating was documented. Active and sluggish behavioural types were distinguished and stable differences in individual activity were observed. Activity was positively correlated with growth during the 4 days of the experiment, but no significant relationship was detected between behaviour during the experiment and overall larval performance in the laboratory setting. These findings demonstrate consistent variation in the foraging behaviour of forest tent caterpillars and lay the basis for further investigatison of its role in colony function and population dynamics. Re´sume´ : Les insectes e´pide´miques sont souvent conside´re´s comme des unite´s identiques, meˆme si des travaux re´cents d’e´cologie comportementale montrent que des diffe´rences persistantes peuvent exister entre les individus et avoir des conse´quences importantes sur la fitness individuelle et les processus de´mographiques. Bien que les entomologistes aient ne´glige´e l’hypothe`se selon laquelle les diffe´rences entre les individus peuvent jouer un roˆle important dans l’e´cologie d’une espe`ce, celle-ci n’est pas nouvelle. Wellington (1957. Can. J.

We combine laboratory and field experiments to show that this nutritionally mediated balance between trail fidelity and exploration generates fission-fusion dynamics, leading to increased mobility and smaller group sizes on poorer quality hosts. Indeed, caterpillar groups feeding on maple spent more time in locomotion, split into smaller groups, switched feeding site more frequently and traveled farther when compared to those feeding on aspen. These fission-fusion dynamics can be explained as an emergent property of individual responses to conspecifics: Individuals drift apart in contexts where responses to cues from conspecifics are weakened. Increased mobility appears as an adaptive response that improves the chances of relocating to a superior food source, but lower group size likely decreases thermoregulation and increases predation. Finally, we show that forest tent caterpillar fission-fusion dynamics not only control the spatial distribution of individuals in a tree, but they are also linked to considerable differences in growth and mortality and therefore can play an important role in population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Partial migration, whereby only a fraction of the population migrates, is thought to be the most common type of migration in the animal kingdom, and can have important ecological and evolutionary consequences. Despite this, the factors that inﬂuence which individuals migrate and which remain resident are poorly understood. Recent work has shown that consistent individual differences in personality traits in animals can be ecologically important, but ﬁeld studies integrating personality traits with migratory behaviour are extremely rare. In this study, we investigate the inﬂuence of individual boldness, an important personality trait, upon the migratory propensity of roach, a freshwater ﬁsh, over two consecutive migration seasons. We assay and individually tag 460 roach and show that boldness inﬂuences migratory propensity, with bold individuals being more likely to migrate than shy ﬁsh. Our data suggest that an extremely widespread personality trait in animals can have signiﬁcant ecological consequences via inﬂuencing individual-level migratory behaviour.},

Fish like Eastern Mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), Bluefin Killifish (Lucania goodei), Golden Topminnow (Fundulus chrysotus) and Sailfin Molly (Poecilia latipinna) annually move to and from temporary wetlands. Field studies have indicated cyclic changes in activity and directionality for some fishes moving across the landscape and that rates vary among species. Laboratory experiments were performed to test the hypotheses that personality traits related to migration, including boldness, exploration and activity vary among fishes from locations with different hydrology and during periods of differing hydrology. Strong dispersers like Eastern Mosquitofish and Golden Topminnow were bolder when water levels were changing and were superior, as explorers of unknown environments, to species whose populations take longer to recover in seasonal wetlands. Poorer dispersers like Bluefin Killifish and Sailfin Molly lacked variation in personality traits related to seasonal dispersal. The results confirm prior studies showing seasonally changing activity levels by migrating fishes and demonstrate that seasonal personality changes are partially responsible. Understanding how and why fish move into and out of temporary wetlands is critical to the management of shorthydroperiod water levels to maintain an accessible food supply for wading birds.},

	abstract = {Animal movement acts at multiple scales: it can shape the destiny of individuals and populations, govern community and ecosystem structure, and influence evolutionary processes and patterns of biodiversity. Recent technological advances, such as the revolutionary developments in tracking technology and remote sensing, provide fresh insights and the possibility to collect detailed data on where and how animals travel through space, how they react to and/or interact with their environment and conspecifics as well as their predators and prey. Scientists from various disciplines ranging from physics to psychology develop and apply ever improving analytical techniques to observe, assess and archive animal movement across scales. As in any other field, standardising data collection is a key prerequisite in order to combine and extend dataset collections, many of which may further be utilized by behavioural ecologists to answer questions on the function and significance of animal movements. Large-scale manipulative experimental approaches have also shed new light on old questions in animal movement, and opened new and previously inaccessible perspectives to study animal movement in the context of behavioural ecology. Animal movements are intrinsic to all behavioural processes, and analysis of movement phenomena within the framework of behavioural ecology has provided rich insights into the mechanisms and functions of animal behavior for some decades. We convened an international symposium to reflect on the behavioural ecology of animal movement, asking how these two related disciplines can produce new insights and synergies. Our symposium provided a platform that brought together a diverse range of researchers working on animal movement on different taxa and a range of spatial scales to discuss how behavioural ecology can integrate with the nascent discipline of movement ecology. In this short paper we summarise the key points from this meeting, and call for a renewed focus on the behavioural processes involved in the movements of animals.},

Beyond the confirmation of the moths’ seasonal, elevational migration in the mid-1900s, little else has been documented about their migratory patterns.To address this missing ecological component, we examined (1) migratory routes during their spring and fall migratory periods throughout their natal range, the Great Plains, and (2) natal origin at two of their summering ranges using stable hydrogen (δ2H) analyses of wings from samples collected within the areas of interest. Stable carbon (δ13C) and stable nitrogen (δ15N) analyses of wings were used to evaluate larval feeding habits of the migrants and agricultural intensity of natal origin sites, respectively. Results suggest that, rather than migrating exclusively east to west, army cutworm moths are also migrating north to south during their spring migration. Moths did not exhibit natal origin site fidelity when returning to the Great Plains. Migrants collected from the Absaroka Range had the highest probability of natal origin in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, the most southern region of the Northwest Territories, and second highest probability of origin in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho. Migrants collected in the Lewis Range had the highest probability of origin in the same provinces of Canada. Results suggest that migrants of the Absaroka Range fed exclusively on C3 plants as larvae and rarely fed in heavily fertilized agroecosystems.},

I describe how environmental sensory cues can trigger the development and progression of the monarch migration, as well as inform sensory-based movement mechanisms in order to travel to and reach their goal destination, despite monarchs being on their maiden voyage. I also describe how sensory cues can trigger season-appropriate changes in migratory direction during the annual cycle. I conclude this mini-review article by discussing how contemporary environmental challenges threaten the persistence of the monarch migration. Environmental challenges such as climate change and shifting land use can significantly alter the sensory environments that monarchs migrate through, as well as degrade or eliminate the sources of sensory cues that are necessary for successful migration.},

However, the mechanisms they use to successfully reach these sites remain poorly understood. Here, we test whether monarchs are true navigators who can determine their location relative to their final destination using both a “compass” and a “map”. Using flight simulators, we recorded the orientation of wild-caught monarchs in southwestern Ontario and found that individuals generally flew in a southwest direction toward the wintering grounds. When displaced 2,500 km to the west, the same individuals continued to fly in a general southwest direction, suggesting that monarchs use a simple vector-navigation strategy (i.e., use a specific compass bearing without compensating for displacement). Using over 5 decades of field data, we also show that the directional concentration and the angular SD of recoveries from tagged monarchs largely conformed to two mathematical models describing the directional distribution of migrants expected under a vector-navigation strategy. A third analysis of tagged recoveries shows that the increasing directionality of migration from north to south is largely because of the presence of geographic barriers that guide individuals toward overwintering sites. Our work suggests that monarchs breeding in eastern North America likely combine simple orientation mechanisms with geographic features that funnel them toward Mexican overwintering sites, a remarkable achievement considering that these butterflies weigh less than a gram and travel thousands of kilometers to a site they have never seen.},

            Predicting how ecological interactions among vectors or intermediate hosts of human parasites influence transmission potential to humans remains challenging. Here, we focus on human schistosomiasis and demonstrate how resource competition among snails profoundly alters the link between infected snails, the target of control, and schistosome cercariae, the cause of human infections. We integrated an individual-based bioenergetics model of snail and schistosome dynamics with experiments in artificial waterbodies and field observations to anticipate and explain how resource-sensitive schistosome infections and resource competition among snails interact to generate brief peaks in transmission potential when snail populations grow from low densities. A resource-explicit view of snail and schistosome dynamics could maximize the potential for snail control methods to contribute to control of schistosomiasis.
          , 
            Predicting and disrupting transmission of human parasites from wildlife hosts or vectors remains challenging because ecological interactions can influence their epidemiological traits. Human schistosomes, parasitic flatworms that cycle between freshwater snails and humans, typify this challenge. Human exposure risk, given water contact, is driven by the production of free-living cercariae by snail populations. Conventional epidemiological models and management focus on the density of infected snails under the assumption that all snails are equally infectious. However, individual-level experiments contradict this assumption, showing increased production of schistosome cercariae with greater access to food resources. We built bioenergetics theory to predict how resource competition among snails drives the temporal dynamics of transmission potential to humans and tested these predictions with experimental epidemics and demonstrated consistency with field observations. This resource-explicit approach predicted an intense pulse of transmission potential when snail populations grow from low densities, i.e., when per capita access to resources is greatest, due to the resource-dependence of cercarial production. The experiment confirmed this prediction, identifying a strong effect of infected host size and the biomass of competitors on per capita cercarial production. A field survey of 109 waterbodies also found that per capita cercarial production decreased as competitor biomass increased. Further quantification of snail densities, sizes, cercarial production, and resources in diverse transmission sites is needed to assess the epidemiological importance of resource competition and support snail-based disruption of schistosome transmission. More broadly, this work illustrates how resource competition can sever the correspondence between infectious host density and transmission potential.},

	abstract = {For small and isolated populations, the increased chance of mating between related individuals can result in a substantial reduction in individual and population fitness. Despite the increasing availability of genomic data to measure inbreeding accurately across the genome, inbreeding depression studies for threatened species are still scarce due to the difficulty of measuring fitness in the wild. Here, we investigate inbreeding and inbreeding depression for the extensively monitored Tiritiri Mātangi island population of a threatened Aotearoa New Zealand passerine, the hihi (Notiomystis cincta). First, using a custom 45 k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, we explore genomic inbreeding patterns by inferring homozygous segments across the genome. Although all individuals have similar levels of ancient inbreeding, highly inbred individuals are affected by recent inbreeding, which can probably be explained by bottleneck effects such as habitat loss after European arrival and their translocation to the island in the 1990s. Second, we investigate genomic inbreeding effects on fitness, measured as lifetime reproductive success, and its three components, juvenile survival, adult annual survival and annual reproductive success, in 363 hihi. We find that global inbreeding significantly affects juvenile survival but none of the remaining fitness traits. Finally, we employ a genome-­wide association approach to test the locus-­specific effects of inbreeding on fitness, and identify 13 SNPs significantly associated with lifetime reproductive success. Our findings suggest that inbreeding depression does impact hihi, but at different genomic scales for different traits, and that purging has therefore failed to remove all variants with deleterious effects from this population of conservation concern.},

The effects of Pb stress on S. litura growth and food utilization differed signiﬁcantly between insects of the 1st and 5th generation. The male–female rate of 200 mg kgÀ1 Pb treatment from the 1st generation and 50 mg kgÀ1 Pb treatment from the 5th generation was signiﬁcantly higher than control. No signiﬁcant difference of Pb accumulations was found in larvae, pupae and adults between the 1st and 5th generation. No signiﬁcant difference of Pb accumulations in corresponding tissues of larvae was found between male and female. Compared to fat body, hemolymph, head, foregut and hindgut, the highest Pb accumulation was found in migut of larvae exposed to 200 mg kgÀ1 Pb. TEM showed that expanded intercellular spaces were observed in Pb-treated midgut cells. The nuclei were strongly destroyed by Pb stress, evidenced by chromatin condensation and destroyed nuclear envelope. Mitochondria became swollen with some broken cristae after exposure to Pb. Therefore, neither gender nor progeny difference was present in Pb accumulations of S. litura, although effects of Pb stress on S. litura growth and food utilization differed from different generations and genders. Pb accumulations in midgut caused pathological changes in cells ultrastructure, possibly reﬂected the growth and food utilization of S. litura.},

The effects of sucrose and of lead ions were found to be different. In larvae sucrose diet inhibited the fatty acid elongation and stimulated the first stages of their unsaturation. A significant increase of phytosterol concentrations was obtained. These changes increased the cell membrane permeability. The addition of lead caused a decrease of the fatty acid unsaturation, which decreased the cell membrane permeability. In adults the sucrose diet had no effect on the lipid and sterol composition, while the addition of lead decreased the cholesterol concentration. The composition of lipids and sterols also depends on the diet of larvae before pupation. The data obtained suggested that changes in lipid and sterol composition, which control the permeability of the cell membrane, might be an adaptive response of the organism to the changes of the environment. ᮊ 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This investigation focused speciﬁcally on cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) accumulation in 43 wild plant species and corresponding soils near a Pb smelting contaminated area. Soils in the study area had elevated Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations, with pollution indices ranked as Cd {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Zn. Aboveground plant heavy metal concentrations ranked Pb {\textgreater} Zn {\textgreater} Cd {\textgreater} Cu, with plants having greater bioconcentration factor (BCF) values for Cd than for Pb, Cu and Zn. Plant Cd BCF averaged 1.42, while Pb, Cu and Zn averaged 0.128, 0.256 and 0.560, respectively. The greatest Cd BCF value was 5.40 for Dendranthema indicum; Cd accumulation for this species has not been reported previously. The greatest shoot Cd concentration (66.5 mg kg−1) was found in Viola verecunda. Signiﬁcant correlations existed between plant shoot Cd and Pb concentrations and soil total and DTPA-extractable Cd and Pb. Plant species with greater heavy metal accumulation could potentially be used for phytoextraction in the study area, while those having less accumulation potentially being used to reduce heavy metal ﬂow into the food chain, reducing the health risks associated with elevated heavy metal soil contamination.},

                Among long-distance migratory insects, the monarch butterfly (
                Danaus plexippus
                ) is one of the most iconic, whose journey is fueled by nectar from flowering plants along the migratory route which may involve up to 3,500 km. Understanding how and where monarchs obtain their dietary resources to fuel migratory flight and ensure overwintering stores would provide new insights into the migratory strategy of this species and subsequently help focus conservation efforts.

                Data from controlled laboratory isotopic tracer tests suggested that adult monarchs convert their dietary energy mainly into 16:0 and 18:1 fatty acids and store them as neutral lipids in their abdomen. FA isotopic composition reflects not only dietary sources but also subsequent isotopic fractionation from metabolism. On the other hand, δ

	abstract = {Many organisms inhabiting seasonal environments exhibit adaptive developmental plasticity, allowing them to optimally match life-history traits with fluctuating conditions. This critically relies on environmental cues, such as temperature, as predictors for seasonal transitions. In most seasonal environments, multiple factors vary together, but might not be equally relevant as cue, making it crucial to understand their combined effects on an organism’s phenotype. Here, we study plasticity in a multivariate environment in the seasonally polyphenic butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Using a full-factorial design, we test how developmental temperature and host plant quality interact to affect life-history traits. Our results show that the cues interact: reduced food quality can act as a predictive cue at temperatures normally associated with the food-rich wet season, inducing a partial dry season phenotype. At low temperatures, normally associated with the food-poor dry season, reduced food quality had an adverse effect on life history, with decreased body mass and prolonged development time. However, metabolic rates in adults were not affected, indicating that individuals could partly compensate for stressful juvenile conditions. Thus, under certain environmental conditions, a single cue (e.g. temperature) might suffice to shape an organisms’ phenotype, while under other conditions additional cues (like plant quality) might be needed in shaping the organism’s phenotype to optimally match seasonal conditions. Our study reveals complex interactive effects of two environmental variables on seasonal plasticity, highlighting the importance of studying multivariate environmental factors to better understand the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in the wild.},

	abstract = {The Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus nerka typically occurs as a sea-run form (sockeye salmon) or may reside permanently in lakes (kokanee) thoughout its native North Pacific. We tested whether such geographically extensive ecotypic variation resulted from parallel evolutionary divergence thoughout the North Pacific or whether the two forms are monophyletic groups by examining allelic variation between sockeye salmon and kokanee at two minisatellite DNA repeat loci and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Bgl II restriction sites. Our examination of over 750 fish from 24 populations, ranging from Kamchatka to the Columbia River, identified two major genetic groups of North Pacific O. nerka: a "northwestern" group consisting of fish from Kamchatka, western Alaska, and northwestern British Columbia, and a "southern" group consisting of sockeye salmon and kokanee populations from the Fraser and Columbia River systems. Maximum-likelihood analysis accompanied by bootstrapping provided strong support for these two genetic groups of O. nerka; the populations did not cluster by migratory form, but genetic affinities were organized more strongly by geographic proximity. The two major genetic groups resolved in our study probably stem from historical isolation and dispersal of O. nerka from two major Wisconsinan glacial refugia in the North Pacific. There were significant minisatellite DNA allele frequency differences between sockeye salmon and kokanee populations from different parts of the same watershed, between populations spawning in different tributaries of the same lake, and also between sympatric populations spawning in the same stream at the same time. MtDNA Bgl II restriction site variation was significant between sockeye salmon and kokanee spawning in different parts of the same major watershed but not between forms spawning in closer degrees of reproductive sympatry. Patterns of genetic affinity and allele sharing suggested that kokanee have arisen from sea-run sockeye salmon several times independently in the North Pacific. We conclude that sockeye salmon and kokanee are para- and polyphyletic, respectively, and that the present geographic distribution ofthe ecotypes results from parallel evolutionary origins of kokanee from sockeye (divergences between them) thoughout the North Pacific.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The increasing feasibility of assembling large genomic datasets for non-model species presents both opportunities and challenges for applied conservation and management. A popular theme in recent studies is the search for large-effect loci that explain substantial portions of phenotypic variance for a key trait(s). If such loci can be linked to adaptations, 2 important questions arise: 1) Should information from these loci be used to reconfigure conservation units (CUs), even if this conflicts with overall patterns of genetic differentiation? 2) How should this information be used in viability assessments of populations and larger CUs? In this review, we address these questions in the context of recent studies of Chinook salmon and steelhead (anadromous form of rainbow trout) that show strong associations between adult migration timing and specific alleles in one small genomic region. Based on the polygenic paradigm (most traits are controlled by many genes of small effect) and genetic data available at the time showing that early-migrating populations are most closely related to nearby late-migrating populations, adult migration differences in Pacific salmon and steelhead were considered to reflect diversity within CUs rather than separate CUs. Recent data, however, suggest that specific alleles are required for early migration, and that these alleles are lost in populations where conditions do not support early-migrating phenotypes. Contrasting determinations under the US Endangered Species Act and the State of California’s equivalent legislation illustrate the complexities of incorporating genomics data into CU configuration decisions. Regardless how CUs are defined, viability assessments should consider that 1) early-migrating phenotypes experience disproportionate risks across large geographic areas, so it becomes important to identify early-migrating populations that can serve as reliable sources for these valuable genetic resources; and 2) genetic architecture, especially the existence of large-effect loci, can affect evolutionary potential and adaptability.},

	abstract = {The migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, is the most widely distributed grasshopper species in the world. However, its global genetic structure and phylogeographic relationships have not been investigated. In this study, we explored the worldwide genetic structure and phylogeography of the locust populations based on the sequence information of 65 complete mitochondrial genomes and three mitochondrial genes of 263 individuals from 53 sampling sites. Although this locust can migrate over long distances, our results revealed high genetic differentiation among the geographic populations. The populations can be divided into two different lineages: the Northern lineage, which includes individuals from the temperate regions of the Eurasian continent, and the Southern lineage, which includes individuals from Africa, southern Europe, the Arabian region, India, southern China, South-east Asia and Australia. An analysis of population genetic diversity indicated that the locust species originated from Africa. Ancestral populations likely separated into Northern and Southern lineages 895 000 years ago by vicariance events associated with Pleistocene glaciations. These two lineages evolved in allopatry and occupied their current distributions in the world via distinct southern and northern dispersal routes. Genetic differences, caused by the long-term independent diversification of the two lineages, along with other factors, such as geographic barriers and temperature limitations, may play important roles in maintaining the present phylogeographic patterns. Our phylogeographic evidence challenged the long-held view of multiple subspecies in the locust species and tentatively divided it into two subspecies, L. m. migratoria and L. m. migratorioides.},

AMOVA analysis of genetic variations in all the populations indicated greater within- (79.55\%) than among-population variability (20.45\%), and that there were significant differentiations among the populations; 11 populations were divided into four regional groups, with significantly greater variability within (82.99\%) than among the groups (17.01\%), and there existed apparent regional differentiations. Paired comparisons showed significantly greater variability within- than between-groups, indicating significant differentiations between populations of different regional groups. Of all the pairwise comparisons, Hainan and Tibetan groups displayed the greatest differentiation, with the difference between the two groups being seven folds of that between populations within the groups; the least differentiations were exhibited between the groups of Hainan, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, with the differences between groups being only half of the differences between populations within the groups. Mantel tests of the genetic and spatial distances showed that the two matrices were significantly correlated (p{\textless}0.01), indicating that the geographical isolation played an important role in the differentiations of the geographical populations of the migratory locusts. Cluster analysis divided all populations into four major groups: Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia group, the Great Plains of North China (the Yellow River and Huai River Plains) group, Hainan group, and Tibet group. Principal component analysis (PCA) supported the division of populations based on the cluster analysis. However, analysis of individuals clustered the locusts into five populations: Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, Hami in Xinjiang, the Great Plains of North China, Hainan, and Tibet. The locust populations in eastern China displayed apparently continous and gradient variations; as such authors consider that there were no necessity and valid reasons for further division of subspecies. The subspecific status for the main geographical populations of the migratory locusts in China was discussed.},

We analyse genetic variation within and between 24 populations at 14 microsatellites in Western Europe, where only ancient and low-intensity outbreaks have been reported (non-outbreaking populations), and in Madagascar and Northern China, where frequent and intense outbreak events have been recorded over the last century (outbreaking populations). Our comparative survey shows that (i) the long-term effective population size is similar in outbreaking and non-outbreaking populations, as evidenced by similar estimates of genetic diversity, and (ii) gene flow is substantially larger among outbreaking populations than among non-outbreaking populations, as evidenced by a fourfold to 30-fold difference in FST values. We discuss the implications for population dynamics and the consequences for management strategies of the observed patterns of genetic variation in L. migratoria populations with contrasting historical outbreak frequency and extent.},

We scored 14 microsatellites in nine subspecies from 25 populations distributed over most of the species’ range in regions that vary in the historical frequency and extent of their outbreaks. We rejected the hypothesis that L. migratoria consists of two genetically distinct clusters adapted to habitats either rarely (nonoutbreaking) or cyclically (outbreaking) favourable to increases in population density. We also invalidated the current subspecific taxonomic classification based on morphometrics. Bayesian inferences indicated evidence of a homogenizing effect of outbreaks on L. migratoria population structure. Geographical and ecological barriers to gene flow in conjunction with historical events can also explain the observed patterns. By systematically assessing the effects of null alleles using computer simulations, we also provide a template for the analysis of microsatellite data sets characterized by a high prevalence of null alleles.},

The populations exhibit significant differences in their life history traits, e.g. butterflies from fragmented landscapes have higher flight metabolic rate and dispersal rate in the field, and higher larval growth rate, than butterflies from continuous landscapes. In fragmented landscapes, local populations are small and have a high risk of local extinction, and hence the long-term persistence at the landscape level is based on frequent re-colonization of vacant habitat patches, which is predicted to select for increased dispersal rate. Using RNA-seq data and a common garden experiment, we found that a large number of genes (1,841) were differentially expressed between the landscape types. Hexamerin genes, the expression of which has previously been shown to have high heritability and which correlate strongly with larval development time in the Glanville fritillary, had higher expression in fragmented than continuous landscapes. Genes that were more highly expressed in butterflies from newly-established than old local populations within a fragmented landscape were also more highly expressed, at the landscape level, in fragmented than continuous landscapes. This result suggests that recurrent extinctions and re-colonizations in fragmented landscapes select a for specific expression profile. Genes that were significantly up-regulated following an experimental flight treatment had higher basal expression in fragmented landscapes, indicating that these butterflies are genetically primed for frequent flight. Active flight causes oxidative stress, but butterflies from fragmented landscapes were more tolerant of hypoxia. We conclude that differences in gene expression between the landscape types reflect genomic adaptations to landscape fragmentation.},

In migratory butterﬂies, host plant abundance and quality may act as environmental cues to switch between the two states, but the mechanisms regulating this process are virtually unknown. Here, we used an experimental set-up to assess how variation in host plant abundance aﬀected the activity of regulatory elements in the painted lady butterﬂy (Vanessa cardui), a model species for insect migratory behaviour studies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) was used to evaluate histone tail modiﬁcations of H3K27ac and H3K4me3, as a proxy for regulatory activity. The results indicate that recently eclosed females that had access to host plants invested in reproduction at an earlier stage and that variation in host plant abundance triggered signiﬁcant diﬀerences in regulatory element activity via histone tail acetylation. The functions of genes in the vicinity of diﬀerentially activated regions were primarily associated with metabolism, egg shell formation, female receptivity, muscle activity, pheromone binding and chromosome maintenance. Our results provide a ﬁrst glimpse into the regulatory underpinnings of how females perceive the environment and allocate resources for either migration or reproduction and a starting point for more detailed understanding of the links between environmental variation, gene regulation and behaviour in butterﬂies.},

The transformations involves changes in behaviour, colour, development, morphometry, fecundity and endocrine physiology. Recession populations of the desert locust exist primarily in the solitary phase as small populations in patchy environments and are prone to extinction because of climatic events. Signiﬁcant genetic differentiation among recession populations along the Red Sea coast of Eritrea was previously reported. It was hypothesized that despite the mixing effect of recurrent swarms, metapopulation dynamics could have produced genetic divergence among these highly scattered recession populations. A Monte Carlo simulation of the population dynamics of the desert locust in a metapopulation setting, with a realistic range of parameter values clearly demonstrated that this is possible. Population growth was represented by a discretetime logistic equation. The duration of recessions and swarms was sampled from normal distributions whose means and standard deviations were varied based on reported estimates. An average recession duration of 10 ± 3 generations and swarm periods half as long but almost twice as variable produced a partitioning of the total genetic variance most similar to that in the empirical study. In conventional metapopulation analysis, whether turnover leads to increased or reduced divergence is dependent on the number of colonists relative to the number of recurrent migrants, and on whether the colonists arise from a single patch or many patches. In the case of locusts, the stochastic boom and bust cycle is the overriding factor. Divergence between patches during recession due to founder effect and recurrent drift is balanced by the high rate of mixing during plagues.},

            Long-distance migration of insects impacts food security, public health, and conservation–issues that are especially significant in Africa. Windborne migration is a key strategy enabling exploitation of ephemeral havens such as the Sahel, however, its knowledge remains sparse. In this first cross-season investigation (3 years) of the aerial fauna over Africa, we sampled insects flying 40–290 m above ground in Mali, using nets mounted on tethered helium-filled balloons. Nearly half a million insects were caught, representing at least 100 families from thirteen orders. Control nets confirmed that the insects were captured at altitude. Thirteen ecologically and phylogenetically diverse species were studied in detail. Migration of all species peaked during the wet season every year across localities, suggesting regular migrations. Species differed in flight altitude, seasonality, and associated weather conditions. All taxa exhibited frequent flights on southerly winds, accounting for the recolonization of the Sahel from southern source populations. “Return” southward movement occurred in most taxa. Estimates of the seasonal number of migrants per species crossing Mali at latitude 14°N were in the trillions, and the nightly distances traversed reached hundreds of kilometers. The magnitude and diversity of windborne insect migration highlight its importance and impacts on Sahelian and neighboring ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Eastern spruce budworm moth (
              Choristoneura fumiferana
              (Clem.)) mass outbreaks have widespread economic and ecological consequences. A key explanation for the large-scale spread and synchronization of these outbreaks is the long-distance dispersal (up to 450 km) of moths from hotspots (high-density populations) to lower-density areas. These events have proved difficult to monitor because dispersal flights occur only a few times a year, have no consistent routes, and commonly used tracking methods (e.g., population genetics, mark-recapture, radio telemetry) are inadequate for this system. Confirming immigration and distinguishing between local and immigrant individuals are crucial steps in identifying the physical and ecological drivers of moth dispersal. Here, we test whether isotopes of hydrogen (i.e., delta notation:
              δ
              2
              H) and strontium (i.e., strontium isotope ratios:

              86
              Sr), known to independently vary in space in a predictable manner, can be used to show that an immigration event occurred and to distinguish between local and immigrant adult spruce budworm moths. We used an automated pheromone trap system to collect individuals at six different sites in eastern Canada within and outside the current outbreak area of budworm moths. We first use moth flight behavior and time of capture, currently the best available tool, to determine putative local vs. immigrant status, and then evaluate whether individual

              H differ between putative classes. At two sites, we detect immigrant individuals that differ significantly from putative locals and thus confirm immigration has occurred.

Sites where the collection of putative locals was close in time (hours) or following an immigration event (days) had a less-clear distinction between putative immigrants and locals, and showed signs of mixing between these two groups. We speculate that recent immigration could have led to the misclassification of immigrants as putative locals.

              Dominance is a fundamental concept in molecular genetics and has implications for understanding patterns of genetic variation, evolution, and complex traits. However, despite its importance, the degree of dominance in natural populations is poorly quantified. Here, we leverage multiple mating systems in natural populations of
              Arabidopsis
              to co-estimate the distribution of fitness effects and dominance coefficients of new amino acid changing mutations. We find that more deleterious mutations are more likely to be recessive than less deleterious mutations. Further, this pattern holds across gene categories, but varies with the connectivity and expression patterns of genes. Our work argues that dominance arises as a consequence of the functional importance of genes and their optimal expression levels.},

	abstract = {In the tropical Indian Ocean, the Maldive Islands lack surface freshwater, so are unsuitable for dragonfly reproduction. Nevertheless, millions of dragonflies (Insecta, Odonata; mostly globe skimmer, Pantalaflavescens) appear suddenly every year starting in October. Arrival dates in the Maldives and India demonstrate that the dragonflies travel from southern India, a distance of some 500-1000 km. Dates of arrival and occurrence coincide with the southward passage of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Circumstantial evidence suggests that the dragonflies fly with north-easterly tail winds, within and behind the ITCZ, at altitudes over 1000 m. It is proposed that this massive movement of dragonflies is part of an annual migration across the western Indian Ocean from India to East Africa. Arrival dates in the Seychelles support this hypothesis. Dragonflies also appear (in smaller numbers) in the Maldives in May, with the onset of the southwest monsoon, suggesting a possible return migration from Africa. These proposed migrations of dragonflies, regularly crossing 3500 km or more of open ocean, were previously unknown. It is known that these dragonflies exploit ephemeral rain pools for reproduction; the monsoons and ITCZ bring not only alternating, seasonal rains to India and Africa, but also appropriate winds for dragonflies to follow those rains. Several bird species migrate from India across the western Indian Ocean to wintering grounds in Africa. They do so at the same time as the dragonflies, presumably taking advantage of the same seasonal tail winds. Many of these birds also eat dragonflies; the possible significance of this was not previously appreciated.},

	abstract = {Insect migration redistributes enormous quantities of biomass, nutrients and species globally. A subset of insect migrants perform extreme long-distance journeys, requiring specialized morphological, physiological and behavioral adaptations. The migratory globe skimmer dragonfly (
              Pantala flavescens
              ) is hypothesized to migrate from India across the Indian Ocean to East Africa in the autumn, with a subsequent generation thought to return to India from East Africa the following spring. Using an energetic flight model and wind trajectory analysis, we evaluate the dynamics of this proposed transoceanic migration, which is considered to be the longest regular non-stop migratory flight when accounting for body size. The energetic flight model suggests that a mixed strategy of gliding and active flapping would allow a globe skimmer to stay airborne for up to 230–286 h, assuming that the metabolic rate of gliding flight is close to that of resting. If engaged in continuous active flapping flight only, the flight time is severely reduced to ∼4 h. Relying only on self-powered flight (combining active flapping and gliding), a globe skimmer could cross the Indian Ocean, but the migration would have to occur where the ocean crossing is shortest, at an exceptionally fast gliding speed and with little headwind. Consequently, we deem this scenario unlikely and suggest that wind assistance is essential for the crossing. The wind trajectory analysis reveals intra- and inter-seasonal differences in availability of favorable tailwinds, with only 15.2\% of simulated migration trajectories successfully reaching land in autumn but 40.9\% in spring, taking on average 127 and 55 h respectively. Thus, there is a pronounced requirement on dragonflies to be able to select favorable winds, especially in autumn. In conclusion, a multi-generational, migratory circuit of the Indian Ocean by the globe skimmer is shown to be achievable, provided that advanced adaptations in physiological endurance, behavior and wind selection ability are present. Given that migration over the Indian Ocean would be heavily dependent on the assistance of favorable winds, occurring during a relatively narrow time window, the proposed flyway is potentially susceptible to disruption, if wind system patterns were to be affected by climatic change.},

              Males and females often differ in their fitness optima for shared traits that have a shared genetic basis, leading to sexual conflict. Morphologically differentiated sex chromosomes can resolve this conflict and protect sexually antagonistic variation, but they accumulate deleterious mutations. However, how sexual conflict is resolved in species that lack differentiated sex chromosomes is largely unknown. Here we present a chromosome-anchored genome assembly for rainbow trout (
              Oncorhynchus mykiss
              ) and characterize a 55-Mb double-inversion supergene that mediates sex-specific migratory tendency through sex-dependent dominance reversal, an alternative mechanism for resolving sexual conflict. The double inversion contains key photosensory, circadian rhythm, adiposity and sex-related genes and displays a latitudinal frequency cline, indicating environmentally dependent selection. Our results show sex-dependent dominance reversal across a large autosomal supergene, a mechanism for sexual conflict resolution capable of protecting sexually antagonistic variation while avoiding the homozygous lethality and deleterious mutations associated with typical heteromorphic sex chromosomes.},

	abstract = {Atlantic cod is composed of multiple migratory and stationary populations widely distributed in the North Atlantic Ocean. The Northeast Arctic cod (NEAC) population in the Barents Sea undertakes annual spawning migrations to the northern Norwegian coast. Although spawning occurs sympatrically with the stationary Norwegian coastal cod (NCC), phenotypic and genetic differences between NEAC and NCC are maintained. In this study, we resolve the enigma by revealing the mechanisms underlying these differences. Extended linkage disequilibrium (LD) and population divergence were demonstrated in a 17.4-Mb region on linkage group 1 (LG1) based on genotypes of 494 SNPs from 192 parents of farmed families of NEAC, NCC or NEACxNCC crosses. Linkage analyses revealed two adjacent inversions within this region that repress meiotic recombination in NEACxNCC crosses. We identiﬁed a NEAC-speciﬁc haplotype consisting of 186 SNPs that was ﬁxed in NEAC sampled from the Barents Sea, but segregating under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in eight NCC stocks. Comparative genomic analyses determine the NEAC conﬁguration of the inversions to be the derived state and date it to {\textasciitilde}1.6–2.0 Mya. The haplotype block harbours 763 genes, including candidates regulating swim bladder pressure, haem synthesis and skeletal muscle organization conferring adaptation to long-distance migrations and vertical movements down to large depths. Our results suggest that the migratory ecotype experiences strong directional selection for the two adjacent inversions on LG1. Despite interbreeding between NEAC and NCC, the inversions are maintaining genetic differentiation, and we hypothesize the co-occurrence of multiple adaptive alleles forming a ‘supergene’ in the NEAC population.},

            Migratory locusts display striking phenotypical plasticity. Gregarious locusts at high density can migrate long distances and cause huge economic losses of crops. By contrast, solitary locusts at low density have limited ability in long-distance flight. However, the mechanisms underlying such flight capacity variation are poorly understood. Here, we found that the flight muscle of solitary locusts has a higher catabolic capacity that is associated with greater reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during high-velocity flights. By contrast, a relatively lower catabolic capacity in gregarious locusts is associated with lower ROS generation during long-distance flights. This finding uncovers the metabolic mechanism of locust flight trait alteration in response to density changes and enhances our understanding of the biological processes enabling locust migration.
          , 
            Flight ability is essential for the enormous diversity and evolutionary success of insects. The migratory locusts exhibit flight capacity plasticity in gregarious and solitary individuals closely linked with different density experiences. However, the differential mechanisms underlying flight traits of locusts are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the variation of flight capacity by using behavioral, physiological, and multiomics approaches. Behavioral assays showed that solitary locusts possess high initial flight speeds and short-term flight, whereas gregarious locusts can fly for a longer distance at a relatively lower speed. Metabolome–transcriptome analysis revealed that solitary locusts have more active flight muscle energy metabolism than gregarious locusts, whereas gregarious locusts show less evidence of reactive oxygen species production during flight. The repression of metabolic activity by RNA interference markedly reduced the initial flight speed of solitary locusts. Elevating the oxidative stress by paraquat injection remarkably inhibited the long-distance flight of gregarious locusts. In respective crowding and isolation treatments, energy metabolic profiles and flight traits of solitary and gregarious locusts were reversed, indicating that the differentiation of flight capacity depended on density and can be reshaped rapidly. The density-dependent flight traits of locusts were attributed to the plasticity of energy metabolism and degree of oxidative stress production but not energy storage. The findings provided insights into the mechanism underlying the trade-off between velocity and sustainability in animal locomotion and movement.},

These effects are often mainly negative, but a growing number of studies suggest that under certain environmental conditions early experience of such stress may yield individuals that are less sensitive to environmental stress later on in life. We used the butterﬂy Bicyclus anynana to study the effects of limited larval and adult food and forced ﬂight on individual performance measured as reproduction and adult life span. Larvae exposed to food stress showed longer development and produced smaller adults. Thus, they were not able to fully compensate for the food deprivation during development. Females that experienced food stress during development did not increase tolerance for adult food limitation. However, females exposed to food stress during development coped better with forced ﬂight compared with the control group. The apparent absence of costs of ﬂight in poor-quality females may be a by-product of an altered body allocation, as females experiencing both food stress treatments had increased thorax ratios, compared with controls, and increased ﬂight performances. The results reveal an important plasticity component to variation in ﬂight performance and suggest that the cost of ﬂight depends on an individual’s internal condition.},

	abstract = {Understanding dispersal is of prime importance in conservation and population biology. Individual traits related to motion and navigation during dispersal may differ: (1) among species differing in habitat distribution, which in turn, may lead to interspecific differences in the potential for and costs of dispersal, (2) among populations of a species that experiences different levels of habitat fragmentation; (3) among individuals differing in their dispersal strategy and (4) between the sexes due to sexual differences in behaviour and dispersal tendencies. In butterflies, the visual system plays a central role in dispersal, but exactly how the visual system is related to dispersal has received far less attention than flight morphology. We studied two butterfly species to explore the relationships between flight and eye morphology, and dispersal. We predicted interspecific, intraspecific and intersexual differences for both flight and eye morphology relative to i) species-specific habitat distribution, ii) variation in dispersal strategy within each species and iii) behavioural differences between sexes. However, we did not investigate for potential population differences. We found: (1) sexual differences that presumably reflect different demands on both male and female visual and flight systems, (2) a higher wing loading (i.e. a proxy for flight performance), larger eyes and larger facet sizes in the frontal and lateral region of the eye (i.e. better navigation capacities) in the species inhabiting naturally fragmented habitat compared to the species inhabiting rather continuous habitat, and (3) larger facets in the frontal region in dispersers compared to residents within a species. Hence, dispersers may have similar locomotory capacity but potentially better navigation capacity. Dispersal ecology and evolution have attracted much attention, but there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms of dispersal. Unfortunately, for many species we lack detailed information on the role of behavioural, morphological and physiological traits for dispersal. Our novel study supports the existence of inter- and intra-specific evolutionary responses in both motion and navigation capacities (i.e. flight and eye morphology) linked to dispersal.},

While spatial cognition observed in vertebrates has been well characterised in recent decades, of no less interest are the great strides that have also been made in characterizing and understanding the behavioural and cognitive basis of orientation and navigation in invertebrate models and in particular insects. Insects are known to exhibit remarkable spatial cognitive abilities and are able to successfully migrate over long distances or pinpoint known locations relying on multiple navigational strategies similar to those found in vertebrate models—all while operating under the constraint of relatively limited neural architectures. Insect orientation and navigation systems are often tailored to each species’ ecology, yet common mechanistic principles can be observed repeatedly. Of these, reliance on visual cues is observed across a wide number of insect groups. In this review, we characterise some of the behavioural strategies used by insects to solve navigational problems, including orientation over short-distances, migratory heading maintenance over long distances, and homing behaviours to known locations. We describe behavioural research using examples from a few well-studied insect species to illustrate how visual cues are used in navigation and how they interact with non-visual cues and strategies.},

Selecting the Golden Birdwing (Troides aeacus) as an example, we demonstrate an effective way to simultaneously record the activity of multiple birdwing butterflies using radio telemetry in hard-to-access mountainous terrain. During the summer flight period of T. aeacus (June and July), a single researcher was able to obtain 30-min records of movement patterns for ten individuals for an average of 4 days by fastening 0.22 g transmitters onto the butterflies, in the mountainous valleys of Mt. Gongga, China. The maximum distance the butterflies traveled over the 4 day period was 4314 m away from the starting location. During this time, the average dispersal rate was 38.07 m/h (n = 9, sd = 85.11); average movement speed was 293.48 m/h (n = 9, sd = 121.45). Flight patterns of butterflies collected from low and high elevation habitats showed no significant differences. Activity levels of individuals from both low and high elevation habitats track diurnal fluctuation in temperature. Flight activity is positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with humidity. Our data provide basic parameters of real-time flight activity and dispersal ability for a species of conservation importance. The methodology is highly suitable for monitoring endangered lepidopteran species in otherwise difficult-to-access terrain.},

Evolutionary models predict that, given sufﬁcient heritable variation, dispersal rate responds to natural selection imposed by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we estimate phenotypic variance components and heritability of ﬂight and resting metabolic rates (RMRs) in an ecological model species, the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy, in which ﬂight metabolic rate (FMR) is known to correlate strongly with dispersal rate. We modelled a two-generation pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that FMR is signiﬁcantly heritable, with additive genetic variance accounting for about 40\% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal inﬂuences on ﬂight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of ﬂight metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions, environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly inﬂuenced by maternal effects. This study contributes to a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of dispersal-related traits, a pressing question in view of the challenges posed to many species by changing climate and fragmentation of natural habitats.},

            There is now clear evidence that species across a broad range of taxa harbor extensive heritable variation in dispersal. While studies suggest that this variation can facilitate demographic outcomes such as range expansion and invasions, few have considered the consequences of intraspecific variation in dispersal for the maintenance and distribution of genetic variation across fragmented landscapes. Here, we examine how landscape characteristics and individual variation in dispersal combine to predict genetic structure using genomic and spatial data from the Glanville fritillary butterfly. We used linear and latent factor mixed models to identify the landscape features that best predict spatial sorting of alleles in the dispersal-related gene phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi). We next used structural equation modeling to test if variation in Pgi mediated gene flow as measured by Fst at putatively neutral loci. In a year when the population was recovering following a large decline, individuals with a genotype associated with greater dispersal ability were found at significantly higher frequencies in populations isolated by water and forest, and these populations showed lower levels of genetic differentiation at neutral loci. These relationships disappeared in the next year when metapopulation density was high, suggesting that the effects of individual variation are context dependent. Together our results highlight that (1) more complex aspects of landscape structure beyond just the configuration of habitat can be important for maintaining spatial variation in dispersal traits and (2) that individual variation in dispersal plays a key role in maintaining genetic variation across fragmented landscapes.},

              Maniola jurtina

Young female adults were submitted to four nectar treatments (i.e. nectar quality and quantity) in outdoor flight cages. IL individuals had better flight capacities in a flight mill and had lower resting metabolic rates (RMR) than EL individuals, except under the severest treatment. Under this treatment, RMR increased in IL individuals, but decreased in EL individuals; flight performance was maintained by IL individuals, but dropped by a factor 2.5 in EL individuals. IL individuals had more canalized (i.e. less plastic) responses relative to the nectar treatments than EL individuals. Our results show significant intraspecific variation in the locomotor and metabolic response of a butterfly to different energy income regimes relative to the landscape of origin.

Additionally, dispersal via ﬂight is especially important for species living in fragmented landscapes. Even though, based on life-history theory, a negative relationship may be expected between ﬂight and immunity, a number of previous studies have indicated ﬂight to induce an increased immune response. In this study, we assessed whether induced immunity (i.e. immune gene expression) in response to 15-min forced ﬂight treatment impacts individual survival of bacterial infection in the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy (Melitaea cinxia). We were able to conﬁrm previous ﬁndings of ﬂight-induced immune gene expression, but still observed substantially stronger effects on both gene expression levels and life span due to bacterial infection compared to ﬂight treatment. Even though gene expression levels of some immunityrelated genes were elevated due to ﬂight, these individuals did not show increased survival of bacterial infection, indicating that ﬂight-induced immune activation does not completely protect them from the negative effects of bacterial infection. Finally, an interaction between ﬂight and immune treatment indicated a potential trade-off: ﬂight treatment increased immune gene expression in na€ıve individuals only, whereas in infected individuals no increase in immune gene expression was induced by ﬂight. Our results suggest that the up-regulation of immune genes upon ﬂight is based on a general stress response rather than reﬂecting an adaptive response to cope with potential infections during ﬂight or in new habitats.},

	abstract = {Flight is essential for foraging, mate searching and dispersal in many insects, but ﬂight metabolism in ectotherms is strongly constrained by temperature. Thermal conditions vary greatly in natural populations and may hence restrict ﬁtness-related activities. Working on the Glanville fritillary butterﬂy (Melitaea cinxia), we studied the effects of temperature experienced during the ﬁrst 2 days of adult life on ﬂight metabolism, genetic associations between ﬂight metabolic rate and variation in candidate metabolic genes, and genotype–temperature interactions. The maximal ﬂight performance was reduced by 17\% by 2 days of low ambient temperature (15 °C) prior to the ﬂight trial, mimicking conditions that butterﬂies commonly encounter in nature. A SNP in phosphoglucose isomerase (Pgi) had a signiﬁcant association on ﬂight metabolic rate in males and a SNP in triosephosphate isomerase (Tpi) was signiﬁcantly associated with ﬂight metabolic rate in females. In the Pgi SNP, AC heterozygotes had higher ﬂight metabolic rate than AA homozygotes following low preceding temperature, but the trend was reversed following high preceding temperature, consistent with previous results on genotype–temperature interaction for this SNP. We suggest that these results on 2-day old butterﬂies reﬂect thermal effect on the maturation of ﬂight muscles. These results highlight the consequences of variation in thermal conditions on the time scale of days, and they contribute to a better understanding of the complex dynamics of ﬂight metabolism and ﬂight-related activities under conditions that are relevant for natural populations living under variable thermal conditions.},

The concomitant food stress is expected to detrimentally affect performance, amongst others in dispersal-related traits. Thus, while dispersal is of utmost importance to escape from deteriorating habitat conditions, such conditions may negatively feedback on the ability to do so. Therefore, we here investigate the impact of larval and adult food stress on traits related to dispersal ability, including morphology, physiology, flight performance, and exploratory behavior, in a butterfly. We show that inadequate nutrition during development and in the adult stage diminishes flight performance, despite some reallocation of somatic resources. Detrimental effects of food stress on flight performance were mainly caused by reductions in body mass and storage reserves. Similar results were found for exploratory behavior. Furthermore, exploratory behavior was found to be (moderately) repeatable at the individual level, which might indicate the existence of a personality trait. This notion is further supported by the fact that flight performance and exploratory behavior were positively correlated, potentially suggesting the existence of a dispersal syndrome. In summary, our findings may have important implications for dispersal in natural environments, as the conditions requiring dispersal the most impair flight ability and thereby likely dispersal rates.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial function is fundamental to organismal performance, health and fitness – especially during energetically challenging events, such as migration. With this investigation, we evaluated mitochondrial sensitivity to ecologically relevant stressors. We focused on an iconic migrant, the North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), and examined the effects of two stressors: 7 days of food deprivation and infection by the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (known to reduce survival and flight performance). We measured whole-animal resting metabolic rate (RMR) and peak flight metabolic rate, and mitochondrial respiration of isolated mitochondria from the flight muscles. Food deprivation reduced mass-independent RMR and peak flight metabolic rate, whereas infection did not. Fed monarchs used mainly lipids in flight (respiratory quotient 0.73), but the respiratory quotient dropped in food-deprived individuals, possibly indicating switching to alternative energy sources, such as ketone bodies. Food deprivation decreased mitochondrial maximum oxygen consumption but not basal respiration, resulting in lower respiratory control ratio (RCR). Furthermore, food deprivation decreased mitochondrial complex III activity, but increased complex IV activity. Infection did not result in any changes in these mitochondrial variables. Mitochondrial maximum respiration rate correlated positively with mass-independent RMR and flight metabolic rate, suggesting a link between mitochondria and wholeanimal performance. In conclusion, low food availability negatively affects mitochondrial function and flight performance, with potential implications for migration, fitness and population dynamics. Although previous studies have reported poor flight performance in infected monarchs, we found no differences in physiological performance, suggesting that reduced flight capacity may be due to structural differences or low energy stores.},

	abstract = {Athetis lepigone (Möschler) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a polyphagous insect which has caused severe damage to corn seedlings in recent yr in the summer corn region of China. It is suggested that this is a migrant species, which annually produces 4 different host-fed generations, but the discovery of its flight performance on each host has been elusive. The effects of 4 host plants—corn, peanut, soybean, and wheat—on the survival ratio of larvae and on the flight performance of A. lepigone moths were investigated under laboratory conditions. The results indicate that wheat was the comparatively preferred diet for larvae. The flight distance of A. lepigone moths increased from 1 d old to a peak level at 3 d and then declined after 4 d old within a 24 h limited flight time. The positive larval-nutrition relationship in terms of flight capability of A. lepigone moths also resulted in the furthest distance and longest duration from the preferred wheat. The maximum distance covered by a single individual fed on wheat for 24 h was 44.55 km. The max duration of an individual was 21.46 h. However, A. lepigone moths had a comparatively higher maximum immediate speed (max speed) when larvae fed on non-preferred host plants such as corn and peanut. The sex of the moths from different hosts had no effect on flight distance, duration, or max speed. There were 2 peaks in flight duration of all 3 to 4 d old tested moths, which meant 2 groups: short flight and long flight duration. The difference between hosts in terms of distance, duration, and max speed as previously mentioned occurred only in the long flight duration group. All these results enhance understanding of the seasonal population dynamics of this migratory moth in the agricultural ecosystem in China. They also have important implications for natural environments in terms of migration and outbreaks.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Each year, billions of songbirds cross large ecological barriers during their migration. Understanding how they perform this incredible task is crucial to predict how global change may threaten the safety of such journeys. Earlier studies based on radar suggested that most songbirds cross deserts in intermittent flights at high altitude, stopping in the desert during the day, while recent tracking with light loggers suggested diurnal prolongation of nocturnal flights and common non-stop flights for some species. We analyzed light intensity and temperature data obtained from geolocation loggers deployed on 130 individuals of ten migratory songbird species, and show that a large variety of strategies for crossing deserts exists between, but also sometimes within species. Diurnal stopover in the desert is a common strategy in autumn, while most species prolonged some nocturnal flights into the day. Non-stop flights over the desert occurred more frequently in spring than in autumn, and more frequently in foliage gleaners. Temperature recordings suggest that songbirds crossed deserts with flight bouts performed at various altitudes according to species and season, along a gradient ranging from low above ground in autumn to probably {\textgreater}2000 m above ground level, and possibly at higher altitude in spring. High-altitude flights are therefore not the general rule for crossing deserts in migrant songbirds. We conclude that a diversity of migration strategies exists for desert crossing among songbirds, with variations between but also within species.},

              Seasonal plasticity is accomplished via tightly regulated developmental cascades that translate environmental cues into trait changes. Little is known about how alternative splicing and other posttranscriptional molecular mechanisms contribute to plasticity or how these mechanisms impact how plasticity evolves. Here, we use transcriptomic and genomic data from the butterfly
              Bicyclus anynana
              , a model system for seasonal plasticity, to compare the extent of differential expression and splicing and test how these axes of transcriptional plasticity differ in their potential for evolutionary change. Between seasonal morphs, we find that differential splicing affects a smaller but functionally unique set of genes compared to differential expression. Further, we find strong support for the novel hypothesis that spliced genes are more susceptible than differentially expressed genes to erosion of genetic variation due to selection on seasonal plasticity. Our results suggest that splicing plasticity is especially likely to experience genetic constraints that could affect the potential of wild populations to respond to rapidly changing environments.},

	abstract = {What shapes the distribution of nucleotide diversity along the genome? Attempts to answer this question have sparked debate about the roles of neutral stochastic processes and natural selection in molecular evolution. However, the mechanisms of evolution do not act in isolation, and integrative models that simultaneously consider the inﬂuence of multiple factors on diversity are lacking; without them, confounding factors lurk in the estimates. Here we present a new statistical method that jointly infers the genomic landscapes of genealogies, recombination rates and mutation rates. In doing so, our model captures the eﬀects of genetic drift, linked selection and local mutation rates on patterns of genomic variation. We then formalize a causal model of how these microevolutionary mechanisms interact, and cast it as a linear regression to estimate their individual contributions to levels of diversity along the genome. Our analyses reclaim the well-established signature of linked selection in Drosophila melanogaster, but we estimate that the mutation landscape is the major driver of the genome-wide distribution of diversity in this species. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that in many evolutionary scenarios the mutation landscape will be a crucial factor shaping diversity, depending notably on the genomic window size. We argue that incorporating mutation rate variation into the null model of molecular evolution will lead to more realistic inferences in population genomics.},

              ) performs multigenerational migrations between Europe and Africa and has become a model species for insect movement ecology. While the annual migration cycle of this species is well understood for Europe and northernmost Africa, it is still unknown where most individuals spend the winter. Through ENM, we previously predicted suitable breeding grounds in the subhumid regions near the tropics between November and February. In this work, we assess the suitability of these predictions through i) extensive field surveys and ii) two-year monitoring in six countries: a large-scale monitoring scheme to study butterfly migration in Africa. We document new breeding locations, year-round phenological information, and hostplant use. Field observations were nearly always predicted with high probability by the previous ENM, and monitoring demonstrated the influence of the precipitation seasonality regime on migratory phenology. Using the updated dataset, we built a refined ENM for the Palearctic-African range of

	abstract = {Many species of caterpillars have been reported to respond to sound, but there has been limited formal study of what sounds they hear, how they hear them and how they respond to them. Here, we report on hearing in caterpillars of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). Fourth and fifth instar caterpillars respond to sounds by freezing, contracting, and flicking their thorax in a vertical direction. Behavioural responses were evoked by sound frequencies between 50 and 900 Hz, with best sensitivity at 100–200 Hz. The lowest mean threshold was 79 dB SPL ( particle velocity 605 μm s−1) at 150 Hz. When presented with a repeated 200 Hz sound tone, caterpillars habituate by no longer responding. A series of ablation experiments confirmed that the primary sensory receptors are a pair of long hairs, called trichoid sensilla, located on the upper prothorax. These sensilla are ∼450 µm long, rest in a socket and are innervated by a single bipolar sensory neuron. Removal of these setae reduced responses significantly compared with controls. Other setae contributed minimally to hearing in response to 200 Hz tones, and tubercles and prothoracic shields played no apparent role in sound reception. We propose that hearing functions to prevent attacks by aerial insect predators and parasitoids, which produce flight sounds in the frequency range to which the caterpillars are sensitive. This research lays the foundation for further investigations on the function and evolution of hearing in caterpillars, and has significance for the conservation of threatened monarch butterfly larvae living near noisy urban environments and roadways.},

	abstract = {Within populations, phenotypic plasticity may allow adaptive phenotypic variation in response to selection generated by environmental heterogeneity. For instance, in multivoltine species, seasonal changes between and within generations may trigger morphological and physiological variation enhancing fitness under different environmental conditions. These seasonal changes may irreversibly affect adult phenotypes when experienced during development. Yet, the irreversible effects of developmental plasticity on adult morphology have rarely been linked to life-history traits even though they may affect different fitness components such as reproduction, mobility and self-maintenance. To address this issue, we raised larvae of Pieris napi butterflies under warm or cool conditions to subsequently compare adult performance in terms of reproduction performance (as assessed through fecundity), displacement capacity (as assessed through flight propensity and endurance) and selfmaintenance (as assessed through the measurement of oxidative markers). As expected in ectotherms, individuals developed faster under warm conditions and were smaller than individuals developing under cool conditions. They also had more slender wings and showed a higher wing surface ratio. These morphological differences were associated with changes in the reproductive and flight performance of adults, as individuals developing under warm conditions laid fewer eggs and flew larger distances. Accordingly, the examination of their oxidative status suggested that individuals developing under warm conditions invested more strongly into self-maintenance than individuals developing under cool conditions (possibly at the expense of reproduction). Overall, our results indicate that developmental conditions have long-term consequences on several adult traits in butterflies. This plasticity probably acts on life-history strategies for each generation to keep pace with seasonal variations and may facilitate acclimation processes in the context of climate change.},

                The availability of food during early life has been proposed as a key proximate mechanism for the development of variation in behaviour among and within individuals.
              
              
                Individuals can vary amongst each other in their personality, plasticity and predictability and if an individual’s behaviour is correlated across contexts this can lead to behavioural, plasticity and predictability syndromes.
              
              
                
                  In this study, we used a split brood design to raise African clawed frog tadpoles (
                  Xenopus laevis
                  ) on a high or low diet in food availability and measured the distance they swam in a familiar and unfamiliar context eight times during their development.
                
              
              
                In a familiar context, we found that there was an increase in among individual variance in plasticity and predictability in the high food treatment. This shows that when resources are not restricted, individuals are not constrained in the expression of their behaviour at certain phenotypic levels.
              
              
                In an unfamiliar context, we found a different response, with an increase in individual variance in personality in the low but not the high feed tadpoles. As unfamiliar contexts may be riskier, our results highlight that individuals receiving less food may take greater foraging risks in novel contexts.
              
              
                Across contexts, we found a predictability syndrome in the high but not the low feed tadpoles, highlighting that cross-context behaviours can become decoupled in some developmental conditions but remain intact in others.
              
              
                Together our findings show that early life conditions contribute to among individual variation in behaviour but that these may only impact the phenotype at specific phenotypic levels and are context specific.
              
              
                We emphasise that having a fundamental understanding of how early development may promote or constrain individual variation can provide a greater understanding of how individuals and populations may respond to novel conditions brought about by anthropogenic activity.},

However, the role of ontogeny in personality traits is still open to debate and it is not clear whether individual differences in behaviour are maintained across important ontogenetic changes such as metamorphosis. Here, we repeatedly quantified personality in rural and urban populations of the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) at the larval, pupal and adult stages. We detected significant repeatability at all life stages, showing that personality is already present at the immature stages. We found no evidence for landscape-related differences in personality traits, but adult males were bolder and more active than adult females. Adults also became bolder with trial sequence, suggesting habitation to the experimental procedure. Urbanisation, together with sex, affected relationships among larval and adult personality traits. More active larvae with short latencies resulted in more explorative adults. However, this was the case in males of urban origin only, and we detected no such correlation in females or in rural males. We suggest that harsh conditions prevailing in cities may lead to stronger trait integration across metamorphosis but also that these urbanisation-related selective pressures may act differently on males and females.},

Here, we studied phenotypic divergence associated with colonization of human-altered habitats in the Speckled wood (Pararge aegeria). We reared butterflies of woodland, urban and agricultural origins under common garden conditions and we measured boldness and activity at the adult stage. Both behavioural traits were repeatable at the individual level (i.e. personality traits), but we found weak evidence for ecotype-related differences in mean boldness and activity. In line with urban areas being stressful habitats, we found that boldness and activity traits correlate in urban butterflies, while we found no such syndrome in woodland and agricultural butterflies. Our results show that urbanization can alter some aspects of personality in an insect species, but they do not support the prediction that anthropogenic habitats favour boldness.},

A common strategy to cope with harsh environments is to enter diapause, but some species avoid unsuitable conditions by migrating. Despite a growing understanding of migration in the life cycles of some butterfly species, it remains unknown how individuals register and store environmental cues to determine whether and where to migrate. Here, we explored how competition and host plant availability during larval development affect patterns of DNA methylation in the migratory painted lady (Vanessa cardui) butterfly. We identify a set of potentially functional methylome shifts associated with differences in the environment, indicating that DNA methylation is involved in the response to different conditions during larval development. By analysing the transcriptome for the same samples used for methylation profiling, we also uncovered a non-­monotonic relationship between gene body methylation and gene expression. Our results provide a starting point for understanding the interplay between DNA methylation and gene expression in butterflies in general and how differences in environmental conditions during development can trigger unique epigenetic marks that might be important for behavioural decisions in the adult stage.},

In migratory butterﬂies, host plant abundance and quality may act as environmental cues to switch between the two states, but the mechanisms regulating this process are virtually unknown. Here, we used an experimental set-up to assess how variation in host plant abundance aﬀected the activity of regulatory elements in the painted lady butterﬂy (Vanessa cardui), a model species for insect migratory behaviour studies. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) was used to evaluate histone tail modiﬁcations of H3K27ac and H3K4me3, as a proxy for regulatory activity. The results indicate that recently eclosed females that had access to host plants invested in reproduction at an earlier stage and that variation in host plant abundance triggered signiﬁcant diﬀerences in regulatory element activity via histone tail acetylation. The functions of genes in the vicinity of diﬀerentially activated regions were primarily associated with metabolism, egg shell formation, female receptivity, muscle activity, pheromone binding and chromosome maintenance. Our results provide a ﬁrst glimpse into the regulatory underpinnings of how females perceive the environment and allocate resources for either migration or reproduction and a starting point for more detailed understanding of the links between environmental variation, gene regulation and behaviour in butterﬂies.},

Our study of the demographics in the ﬁnal phase of the Viking era is the ﬁrst comprehensive multidisciplinary investigation that includes genetics, isotopes, archaeology, and osteology on a larger scale. This early Christian dataset is particularly important as the earlier common pagan burial tradition during the Iron Age was cremation, hindering large-scale DNA analyses. We present genome-wide sequence data from 23 individuals from the 10th to 12th century Swedish town of Sigtuna. The data revealed high genetic diversity among the early urban residents. The observed variation exceeds the genetic diversity in distinct modern-day and Iron Age groups of central and northern Europe. Strontium isotope data suggest mixed local and non-local origin of the townspeople. Our results uncover the social system underlying the urbanization process of the Viking World of which mobility was an intricate part and was comparable between males and females. The inhabitants of Sigtuna were heterogeneous in their genetic afﬁnities, probably reﬂecting both close and distant connections through an established network, conﬁrming that early urbanization processes in northern Europe were driven by migration.},

	abstract = {The presence of population-speciﬁc phenotypes often reﬂects local adaptation or barriers to gene ﬂow. The co-occurrence of phenotypic polymorphisms that are restricted within the range of a highly mobile species is more difﬁcult to explain. An example of such polymorphisms is in the common quail Coturnix coturnix, a small migratory bird that moves widely during the breeding season in search of new mating opportunities, following ephemeral habitats,1,2 and whose females may lay successive clutches at different locations while migrating.3 In spite of this vagility, previous studies reported a higher frequency of heavier males with darker throat coloration in the southwest of the distribution (I. Jime nez-Blasco et al., 2015, Int. Union Game Biol., conference). We used population genomics and cytogenetics to explore the basis of this polymorphism and discovered a large inversion in the genome of the common quail. This inversion extends 115 Mbp in length and encompasses more than 7,000 genes (about 12\% of the genome), producing two very different forms. Birds with the inversion are larger, have darker throat coloration and rounder wings, are inferred to have poorer ﬂight efﬁciency, and are geographically restricted despite the high mobility of the species. Stable isotope analyses conﬁrmed that birds carrying the inversion have shorter migratory distances or do not migrate. However, we found no evidence of pre- or post-zygotic isolation, indicating the two forms commonly interbreed and that the polymorphism remains locally restricted because of the effect on behavior. This illustrates a genomic mechanism underlying maintenance of geographically structured polymorphisms despite interbreeding with a lineage with high mobility.},

An underemphasized feature of normalization is the assumptions on which the methods rely and how the validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance of the methods. In this article, we explain how assumptions provide the link between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes problems in subsequent analysis.

One tenth of all described species on Earth are Lepidoptera, butterflies and moths, and these generally possess 31 holocentric chromosomes. However, a subset of lepidopteran species display dramatic variation in chromosome counts. By analysing 210 chromosomally-complete lepidopteran genomes, the largest analysis of eukaryotic chromosomal-level reference genomes to date, we show that the diverse karyotypes of extant species are derived from 32 ancestral linkage groups, which we term Merian elements. Merian elements have remained largely intact across 250 million years of evolution and diversification. Against this stable background, we identify eight independent lineages that have evaded constraint and undergone extensive reorganisation either by numerous fissions or a combination of fusion and fission events. Outside these lineages, fusions are rare and fissions are rarer still. Fusions tend to involve small, repeat-rich Merian elements and/or the Z chromosome. Together, our results reveal the constraints on genome architecture in Lepidoptera and enable a deeper understanding of the importance of chromosomal rearrangements in shaping the evolution of eukaryotic genomes.},

	abstract = {Satyrinae butterflies occurring in the Mediterranean apparently have reduced gene flow over sea straits, and for several species, recent wide-scale biodiversity surveys indicate the existence of divergent mitochondrial lineages. Here, we apply an integrative approach and examine the phylogeography of the genus Lasiommata in the Western Palearctic. Our research comprised molecular analyses (mitochondrial and nuclear DNA) and geometric morphometrics (wings and genitalia) for two main species groups, and a comparative GMYC analysis, based on COI, of all the tribes within Satyrinae from this region. The GMYC approach revealed a particularly fast coalescence rate in the Parargina subtribe. The Lasiommata group was divided into 12 evolutionary significant units: six clades for the L. maera species group, five for the L. megera species group, and one for L. petropolitana, with divergences of about 1\%. The patterns of COI were mirrored by ITS2 in L. maera, but the two markers were generally inconsistent in L. megera. On the contrary, morphological differences were coherent with the results of COI for L. megera, but less clearly so for L. maera. L. paramegaera and L. meadewaldoi were considerably differentiated for all the analyzed markers and likely proceeded faster in the process of speciation because of geographic isolation and reduced effective population size, rendering the rest paraphyletic. Our study illustrates the continuous nature of speciation and the difficulties of delimiting species. In Lasiommata, the recognition of taxa as diverging lineages or distinct, possibly paraphyletic species, mostly depends on the criteria adopted by different species concepts.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the distribution and movements of populations of migratory birds is useful for the effective conservation and management of biodiversity. However, such information is often unavailable because of the difficulty of tracking sufficient numbers of individuals. We used more easily obtained feather stable hydrogen isotope ratios (d2H) to predict the summer grounds of the small, threatened, and migratory population of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America. We then identified summer locations and the extent of migratory connectivity for this population. We collected d2H (d2Hf), stable carbon isotope (d13C), and stable nitrogen isotope (d15N) data from the body feathers of 47 juvenile, subadult, and adult Golden Eagles. Values of d13C and d15N suggested that all but 2 birds obtained food from terrestrial-based food webs and therefore that d2H data were appropriate for inferring the geographic region of molt for the majority of birds. There was relatively large interfeather variation in the d2H values of subadults vs. adults, suggesting that these groups molted at different times and places. The most negative d2Hf values from birds with known summering grounds exhibited (1) a negative correlation with their summering latitude, and (2) a positive correlation with amount-weighted d2H values of May–August precipitation at the summer location. These data validate the use of d2Hf values for inferring the summer locations of Golden Eagles of unknown origin. Likelihoodof-origin maps derived from d2Hf values revealed that (1) the majority of birds spent the breeding season in central Que´bec and Labrador, and (2) birds that wintered at southern latitudes, from approximately northern Alabama to southwestern Virginia, migrated about twice the distance of birds that wintered at northern latitudes, from Pennsylvania to New York. We observed a positive relationship between d2Hf values and the latitude of the wintering location, which, along with the likelihood-of-origin maps, revealed moderate patterns of leapfrog migration and migratory connectivity.},

Over the last few decades I. scapularis has expanded its range, introducing a novel health threat into these areas. Warming temperatures appear to be one cause of its range expansion to the north. However, other factors are also involved. We show that unfed adult female ticks infected with B. burgdorferi have greater overwintering survival than uninfected female ticks. Locally collected adult female ticks were placed in individual microcosms and allowed to overwinter in both forest and dune grass environments. In the spring we collected the ticks and tested both dead and living ticks for B. burgdorferi DNA. Infected ticks had greater overwintering survival compared with uninfected ticks every winter for three consecutive winters in both forest and dune grass environments. We discuss the most plausible explanations for this result. The increased winter survival of adult female ticks could enhance tick population growth. Our results suggest that, in addition to climate change, B. burgdorferi infection itself may be promoting the northern range expansion of I. scapularis. Our study highlights how pathogens could work synergistically with climate change to promote host range expansion.},

Stopover period was in general one day except for the light portion of oasis birds which stopped for up to three weeks during which they regained fat. A calculation of the maximum range which can be covered with the available fat depots revealed that nearly all birds from the desert stopover place should be able to cross the desert whereas about 60\% of the oasis birds should not. An intermittant migratory strategy for the desert crossing is proposed with flight during the night and stopover during the day, even without drinking and feeding.},

            Monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus (L.), from eastern North America are well known for their incredible autumn migration to Mexico; however, not all monarchs follow this route. There is evidence of monarchs overwintering and reproducing in Florida, arriving to insular and continental Caribbean, and roosting by the thousands in the Yucatán, Mexico. This work aims to present evidence that these monarchs are part of two current migratory routes, that we consider as the south-eastern and the Atlantic routes, routes that were probably more prominent in the past. Monarchs were collected for 12 months in south Florida, for 4 years in Cuba in November and once in March, in the Yucatán and Guatemala at different times, and once in northern Venezuela. We used two independent techniques, stable hydrogen isotope (δ2H) analyses of the wings and/or thin layer chromatography (TLC), to trace the monarch’s natal grounds. We analysed the DNA of monarchs collected in St. Marks in the Florida Panhandle, Cuba and Guatemala, and compared those data against previously-analysed DNA data from monarchs in the Americas to characterize their genetic structure and to assess the possible movement and presence of North American monarchs and/or their alleles outside the USA. Our results support the existence of south-eastern and Atlantic migratory routes. TLC, isotope and DNA analyses showed the arrival of likely North American monarchs in Cuba, Yucatán, Guatemala, Venezuela and other areas of the Americas. North American monarchs found in these areas have different natal grounds, phenotypic traits and DNA signature than Mexican migrants. Monarchs from the south-eastern route mostly originated in the south-east USA and fed on local Asclepias spp., such as Asclepias viridis, Asclepias humistrata, Asclepias perennis and Asclepias asperula. Butterflies from this migratory route move east, enter the Florida Peninsula, pass to Cuba, fly to the Yucatán and then to Guatemala where they appear to overwinter in the high mountains of Guatemala where Abies guatemalensis occurs. Monarchs that are part of the Atlantic route move east of the Appalachians, enter the Florida Peninsula, and from there pass to the insular and continental Caribbean. The main host plants for the Atlantic monarchs are A. perennis and A. humistrata; in contrast, Mexican monarchs mainly feed on Asclepias syriaca. Some monarchs from these two proposed migratory routes, south-eastern and Atlantic, will stay in the places where they travelled and others will return via Florida and Mexico. We propose a scenario for how the different migratory routes evolved.},

	abstract = {Populations of migratory bird species have suffered a sustained and severe decline for several decades. Contrary to nonmigratory species, understanding the causal mechanisms proves difficult (for migratory bird species) as underlying processes may operate across broad geographic ranges and stages of the annual cycle. Therefore, the identification of migration routes, wintering grounds, and stopover sites is crucial for the development of relevant conservation strategies for declining migrant bird species. We still lack fundamental data of the non-breeding movements for many migratory species, such as European turtle doves Streptopelia turtur, a trans-Saharan migrant. For this species, knowledge of non-breeding movements is mainly based on ringing data that are limited by a low recovery rate in Africa, and tracking studies with a strong bias towards individuals breeding in France. We used Argos satellite transmitters to obtain detailed year-round tracks and provide new insights on migration strategies and winter quarters, of turtle doves breeding in Central and Eastern Europe. The tracking data along with analysis of land cover data confirm previously assumed use of multiple wintering sites and the use of a wide range of forest and agricultural landscapes at the breeding grounds. Tracking data in combination with environmental parameters demonstrated that most environmental parameters and niche breadth differed between breeding and wintering grounds. “Niche tracking” was only observed regarding night-time temperatures. Furthermore, we provide evidence for breeding site fidelity of adult individuals and for home range size to increase with an increasing proportion of agricultural used areas.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Many insect species undertake multi-generational migrations in the Afro-tropical and Palearctic ranges, and understanding their migratory connectivity remains challenging due to their small size, short life span and large population sizes. Hydrogen isotope ( δ 2H) can be used to reconstruct the movement of dispersing or migrating insects, but applying δ 2H for provenance requires a robust isotope baseline map (i.e., isoscape) for the Afro-Palearctic. Methods: We analysed the δ 2H in the wings ( δ 2H wing) of 142 resident butterﬂies from 56 sites across the Afro-Palearctic. The δ 2H wing values were compared to the predicted local growing-season precipitation δ 2H values ( δ 2H GSP) using a linear regression model to develop an insect wing δ 2H isoscape. We used multivariate linear mixed models and high-resolution and time-speciﬁc remote sensing climate and environmental data to explore the controls of the residual δ 2H wing variability. Results: A strong linear relationship was found between δ 2H wing and δ 2H GSP values (r 2=0.53). The resulting isoscape showed strong patterns across the Palearctic but limited variation and high uncertainty for the Afro-tropics. Positive residuals of this relationship were correlated with dry conditions for the month preceding sampling whereas negative residuals were correlated with more wet days for the month preceding sampling. High intra-site δ 2H wing variance was associated with lower relative humidity for the month preceding sampling and higher elevation. Conclusion: The δ 2H wing isoscape is applicable to trace butterﬂies, moths and other terrestrial herbivorous insects that migrate across the Afro-Palearctic range but has limited geolocation potential in the Afro-tropics. The spatial analysis of uncertainty using high-resolution climatic data demonstrated that many African regions with highly variable evaporation rates and relative humidity have δ 2H wing values that are less related to δ 2H GSP values. Increasing geolocation precision will require new modeling approaches using more time-speciﬁc environmental data and/or independent geolocation tools.},

Among the most fundamental of these summary statistics are π and dXY, which are used to describe genetic diversity within and between populations, respectively. Here, we address a widespread issue in π and dXY calculation: systematic bias generated by missing data of various types. Many popular methods for calculating π and dXY operate on data encoded in the variant call format (VCF), which condenses genetic data by omitting invariant sites. When calculating π and dXY using a VCF, it is often implicitly assumed that missing genotypes (including those at sites not represented in the VCF) are homozygous for the reference allele. Here, we show how this assumption can result in substantial downward bias in estimates of π and dXY that is directly proportional to the amount of missing data. We discuss the pervasive nature and importance of this problem in population genetics, and introduce a user-­friendly UNIX command line utility, pixy, that solves this problem via an algorithm that generates unbiased estimates of π and dXY in the face of missing data. We compare pixy to existing methods using both simulated and empirical data, and show that pixy alone produces unbiased estimates of π and dXY regardless of the form or amount of missing data. In summary, our software solves a long-­standing problem in applied population genetics and highlights the importance of properly accounting for missing data in population genetic analyses.},

	abstract = {Stable-isotope analysis of feathers is an increasingly important source of information on diet and movement of birds. Feathers are typically cleaned with a solvent before analysis, but the eﬀects of this cleaning on the resulting data have not been examined critically. We conducted an experiment to determine whether a cleaning regime aﬀected hydrogen (DD), carbon (DC), and nitrogen (DN) stable-isotope ratios in feathers of Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica). A paired design was used to clean feathers with : chloroform: methanol or detergent. Results after initial cleaning indicated enrichment of hydrogen by {\textasciitilde}‰ in feathers treated with : chloroform: methanol-treated compared with other treatments but no correlation between treatments. We found a similar pattern among treatments for carbon, but the eﬀect was on the order of .‰. Nitrogen values showed no discernible correlation, but both uncleaned and : chloroform: methanol treatments had enriched values, on average, compared with detergent treatments. Further, variance among samples was high for hydrogen and nitrogen measurements. After recleaning with alternate treatments, diﬀerences in mean hydrogen-isotope ratios were no longer evident, data for hydrogen and carbon became less variable, and carbon maintained its initial pattern. We suggest a standard method of cleaning feathers, ﬁrst with a dilute detergent solution, then with : chloroform:methanol solvent. This study has implications for increasing repeatability of hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen stable-isotope measurements, which would increase the validity of inter-laboratory comparisons and the utility of large-scale projects using compiled data sets.

	abstract = {Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is a fundamental technology for research to advance precision medicine, but the limited availability of portable and user-friendly workflows for WGS analyses poses a major challenge for many research groups and hampers scientific progress. Here we present Sarek, an open-source workflow to detect germline variants and somatic mutations based on sequencing data from WGS, whole-exome sequencing (WES), or gene panels. Sarek features (i) easy installation, (ii) robust portability across different computer environments, (iii) comprehensive documentation, (iv) transparent and easy-to-read code, and (v) extensive quality metrics reporting. Sarek is implemented in the Nextflow workflow language and supports both Docker and Singularity containers as well as Conda environments, making it ideal for easy deployment on any POSIX-compatible computers and cloud compute environments. Sarek follows the GATK best-practice recommendations for read alignment and pre-processing, and includes a wide range of software for the identification and annotation of germline and somatic single-nucleotide variants, insertion and deletion variants, structural variants, tumour sample purity, and variations in ploidy and copy number. Sarek offers easy, efficient, and reproducible WGS analyses, and can readily be used both as a production workflow at sequencing facilities and as a powerful stand-alone tool for individual research groups.

We identify the transoceanic migration route from years 2002 to 2007 by imposing an energetics-based time-constraint on a modified Dijkstra’s path-planning algorithm incorporating active wind compensation. The prevailing winds play a pivotal role; the Somali Jet enables migration across the Indian Ocean from Africa to India, whereas the return requires stopovers at the disappearing islands of the Maldives and Seychelles. The migration timing, identified using monthly-successful trajectories, life cycle, and precipitation data, corroborates sightings. A branched-network hypothesis connects our sighting in Cherrapunji (North-East India), the likely origin, to the known migration circuit.},

In order to determine the effects of geographical isolation on population genetic structure and wing morphology, 281 individuals of the cosmopolitan odonate Pantala ﬂavescens were collected from four continental (Central and South America) and ﬁve insular sites (Polynesian islands and the Maldives). COI sequences and eight microsatellite loci were used to characterize genetic diversity and genetic structure between and within locations. Linear and geometric morphometry were used to evaluate differences in the size and shape of wings. Genetic analysis showed a global genetic difference between the continental and insular sites. American locations did not show genetic structure, even in locations separated by a distance of 5000 km. Easter Island showed the lowest values of genetic diversity (mainly mitochondrial diversity) and the highest values of genetic differences compared to other insular and continental sites. Individuals from Easter Island showed smaller forewings, a different abdomen length to thorax length ratio, and a different conﬁguration of anal loop in the hindwings. Thus, the greater isolation, smaller area, and young geological age seem to have determined the genetic and morphological differences in P. ﬂavescens of Easter Island, where selection could promote a loss of migratory behavior and may improve other life history traits, such as reproduction. This work provides new insight into how microevolutionary processes operate in isolated populations of cosmopolitan species.},

              to investigate genetic diversity and demographic history among 19 populations of
              P. flavescens
              in eastern the monsoon region of China. In a Bayesian clustering analysis of the microsatellite data, three distinct clades were present, and each population consisted of a mixture of individuals from the three clusters. An AMOVA of the data from both the microsatellite loci and
              Cytb
              revealed that genetic variation was mainly within each population. For the 543 individuals from the 19 regions, 77 unique haplotypes were obtained by DnaSP 4.0, and a median-joining network showed no obvious geographical pattern and displayed high gene flow and minimal population genetic structure among the 19 populations. According to a Mantel test, there was no significant association between genetic distance and geographic distribution and no isolation by distance. Mismatch distribution and neutrality tests showed no demographic expansion for the 19 populations. Microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data suggested there was high gene flow and low differentiation among the populations. These results will help provide valuable information to study the migratory route of insects, especially important agricultural pests.},

	abstract = {Background:  The environment is a strong driver of genetic structure in many natural populations, yet often neglected in population genetic studies. This may be a particular problem in vagile species, where subtle structure cannot be explained by limitations to dispersal. Consequently, these species might falsely be considered quasi-panmictic and hence potentially mismanaged. A species this might apply to, is the buff-tailed bumble bee (Bombus terrestris), an economically important and widespread pollinator, which is considered to be quasi-panmictic at mainland continental scales. Here we aimed to (i) quantify genetic structure in 21+ populations of the buff-tailed bumble bee, sampled throughout two Eastern European countries, and (ii) analyse the degree to which structure is explained by environmental differences, habitat permeability and geographic distance. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we characterised populations of this species with Fst analyses, complemented by discriminant analysis of principal components and Bayesian clustering approaches. We then applied generalized dissimilarity modelling to simultaneously assess the informativeness of geographic distance, habitat permeability and environmental differences among populations in explaining divergence.
Results:  Genetic structure of the buff-tailed bumble bee quantified by means of Fst was subtle and not detected by Bayesian clustering. Discriminant analysis of principal components suggested insignificant but still noticeable structure that slightly exceeded estimates obtained through Fst analyses. As expected, geographic distance and habitat permeability were not informative in explaining the spatial pattern of genetic divergence. Yet, environmental variables related to temperature, vegetation and topography were highly informative, explaining between 33 and 39\% of the genetic variation observed.
Conclusions:  In contrast to previous studies reporting quasi-panmixia in continental populations of this species, we demonstrated the presence of subtle population structure related to environmental heterogeneity. Environmental data proved to be highly useful in unravelling the drivers of genetic structure in this vagile and opportunistic species. We highlight the potential of including these data to obtain a better understanding of population structure and the processes driving it in species considered to be quasi-panmictic.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate analysis that reduces the complexity of datasets while preserving data covariance. The outcome can be visualized on colorful scatterplots, ideally with only a minimal loss of information. PCA applications, implemented in well-cited packages like EIGENSOFT and PLINK, are extensively used as the foremost analyses in population genetics and related fields (e.g., animal and plant or medical genetics). PCA outcomes are used to shape study design, identify, and characterize individuals and populations, and draw historical and ethnobiological conclusions on origins, evolution, dispersion, and relatedness. The replicability crisis in science has prompted us to evaluate whether PCA results are reliable, robust, and replicable. We analyzed twelve common test cases using an intuitive color-based model alongside human population data. We demonstrate that PCA results can be artifacts of the data and can be easily manipulated to generate desired outcomes. PCA adjustment also yielded unfavorable outcomes in association studies. PCA results may not be reliable, robust, or replicable as the field assumes. Our findings raise concerns about the validity of results reported in the population genetics literature and related fields that place a disproportionate reliance upon PCA outcomes and the insights derived from them. We conclude that PCA may have a biasing role in genetic investigations and that 32,000-216,000 genetic studies should be reevaluated. An alternative mixed-admixture population genetic model is discussed.},

	abstract = {The painted lady, Vanessa cardui (Linnaeus, 1758), migrates seasonally between Africa and Europe with a northward multigenerational migration from Africa to Europe in spring and a southward migration from Europe to Africa in autumn. However, little is known about the year-round phenology of this species in southern regions in the Mediterranean Basin. In this study the year-round phenology and reproduction of painted ladies was recorded during a seven-year period (2014–2020) at 7 lowland sites ({\textless} 80 m a.s.l) near the coast of Cádiz (southern Spain). Overall, a total of 2341 painted lady butterﬂies (or 0.56 butterﬂies/ km) were recorded along 4186 km of transects of the Butterﬂy Monitoring Scheme (BMS). Data pooled for all sites and years indicate a migration of painted ladies in autumn (mid and late October), another peak in abundance in winter (late February) and ﬁnally a migration in spring (late May). Abundance, however, varied greatly between sites and years. In July 2019, a spectacular migration of painted ladies was recorded across the study area that was also recorded in other European countries a few weeks later. Territorial behaviour of males, including hill-topping and courtship, oviposition and immature stages were recorded in autumn and winter. Reproductive behaviour was not recorded in spring or summer. Painted ladies were most abundant during the autumn migration, less abundant in spring and much less abundant in winter. This study conﬁrms that the southern tip of Western Europe close to North Africa is an important stop-over region during the migration of painted ladies although numbers ﬂuctuate enormously between years and sites. To my knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that the timing of year-round migration and the reproduction of painted ladies in the autumn-winter months have been described for a southern European population.},

A comparison between V. atalanta and 2 congeners, V. annahella and V. cardui, shows that the degree of site tenacity is correlated with the density of rivals. Males of V. annahella the least , abundant species, are most site tenacious, as measured by mean duration of residency and frequency of return to the peak. In contrast, males of V. cardui experience the highest hilltop densities and are the most ephemeral. Males of V. atalanta occur in intermediate density and exhibit intermediate site tenacity. Although male V. atalanta readily respond to any flying insect, the duration and complexity of these interactions is reduced. The various species also express different perch site preferences, which may aid in reducing the frequency of non-productive congeneric encounters.},

Geographic analysis of genetic structure and stable and radiogenic isotope composition and use of newly developed radio-tracking techniques has been applied to migration in the North American dragon y, Anax junius. Southbound migrants move up to 2,800 km. Developmental phenology suggests early (‘resident’) and late (‘migrant’) cohorts at most sites, but these groups appear genetically identical, and the species is essentially panmictic in eastern North America. Apparently environmental cues and physiological responses to photoperiod and temperature engender migratory behaviour. Successful radio-tracking of individual A. junius has revealed alternating periods of migration and energy replenishment, and responses to wind and temperature similar to avian migration.},

            The genus Anax is a group of cosmopolitan dragonflies noted for its conspicuous migratory behaviours and large size. Here we present the first dated, species-level, multigene, molecular phylogeny for the group to test generic and species-limits, as well as the evolution of migration and range size. Using five mitochondrial and nuclear gene regions (COI, COI/COII, CYTB/ND1, ITS1 and PRMT) from 20 species, we reconstructed a phylogeny of Anax using both a Bayesian and maximum likelihood approach. We found that Anax (including its hypothesized sister group Hemianax) forms a monophyletic group, and that 12 out of 20 species tested positive for monophyly were also monophyletic. The monophyly of several species of Anax is less clear. Migratory behaviour, which is known to occur in at least nine species, is recovered as the ancestral behaviour, which was lost and subsequently gained at least three times. Geographic range size seems to be tightly associated with migratory behaviour.},

This unexpectedly narrow range of diversity is known as Lewontin’s Paradox of Variation (1974). While some have suggested selection constrains diversity, tests of this hypothesis seem to fall short. Here, I revisit Lewontin’s Paradox to assess whether current models of linked selection are capable of reducing diversity to this extent. To quantify the discrepancy between pairwise diversity and census population sizes across species, I combine previouslypublished estimates of pairwise diversity from 172 metazoan taxa with newly derived estimates of census sizes. Using phylogenetic comparative methods, I show this relationship is significant accounting for phylogeny, but with high phylogenetic signal and evidence that some lineages experience shifts in the evolutionary rate of diversity deep in the past. Additionally, I find a negative relationship between recombination map length and census size, suggesting abundant species have less recombination and experience greater reductions in diversity due to linked selection. However, I show that even assuming strong and abundant selection, models of linked selection are unlikely to explain the observed relationship between diversity and census sizes across species.},

We also document other recent observations of large swarm migrations of dragonﬂies in eastern North America, review previous reports of this phenomenon, and compare these events to the ﬂights at Chicago, Cape May and Crescent Beach. Records of large dragonﬂy migrations show several distinct patterns: (1) all reports fell between late July and midOctober, with a peak in September; (2) most of the large ﬂights occurred along topographic leading lines such as coastlines and lakeshores; (3) massive swarm migrations generally followed the passage of synoptic-scale cold fronts; and (4) the common green darner (Anax junius) was the principal species involved in the majority of these ﬂights. Striking parallels between the patterns of seasonal timing, geographical distribution, and meteorological context of dragonﬂy migrations and those of birds suggest that similar causal factors are involved.},

We tested for climate change-­associated evolution of this plasticity by replicating common garden experiments conducted on two Swedish populations 30 years ago. We found evidence for evolutionary change in the contemporary larval reaction norm—­although these changes differed between populations—­but no evidence for evolution of the pupal reaction norm.

This dependency can lead to difﬁculties in interpretation and in the comparison of estimates among species or among loci and has led to the development of two replacement statistics, F¢ST and D. F¢ST is the normal FST standardized by the maximum value it can obtain, given the observed within-population diversity. D uses a multiplicative partitioning of diversity, based on the effective number of alleles rather than on the expected heterozygosity. In this study, we review the relationships between the three classes of statistics (FST, F¢ST and D), their estimation and their properties. We illustrate the relationships between the statistics using a data set of estimates from 84 species taken from the last 4 years of Molecular Ecology. As with FST, unbiased estimators are available for the two new statistics D and F¢ST. Here, we develop a new unbiased F¢ST estimator based on GST, which we call G¢¢ST. However, F¢ST can be calculated using any FST estimator for which the maximum value can be obtained. As all three statistics have their advantages and their drawbacks, we recommend continued use of FST in combination with either F¢ST or D. In most cases, F¢ST would be the best choice among the latter two as it is most suited for inferences of the inﬂuence of demographic processes such as genetic drift and migration on genetic population structure.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing and the collection of genome-wide data allow identifying adaptive variation and footprints of directional selection. Using a large SNP data set from 259 RAD-sequenced European eel individuals (glass eels) from eight locations between 34 and 64oN, we examined the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity across locations. We tested for local selection by searching for increased population differentiation using FST-based outlier tests and by testing for signiﬁcant associations between allele frequencies and environmental variables. The overall low genetic differentiation found (FST = 0.0007) indicates that most of the genome is homogenized by gene ﬂow, providing further evidence for genomic panmixia in the European eel. The lack of genetic substructuring was consistent at both nuclear and mitochondrial SNPs. Using an extensive number of diagnostic SNPs, results showed a low occurrence of hybrids between European and American eel, mainly limited to Iceland (5.9\%), although individuals with signatures of introgression several generations back in time were found in mainland Europe. Despite panmixia, a small set of SNPs showed high genetic differentiation consistent with single-generation signatures of spatially varying selection acting on glass eels. After screening 50 354 SNPs, a total of 754 potentially locally selected SNPs were identiﬁed. Candidate genes for local selection constituted a wide array of functions, including calcium signalling, neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction and circadian rhythm. Remarkably, one of the candidate genes identiﬁed is PERIOD, possibly related to differences in local photoperiod associated with the {\textgreater}30° difference in latitude between locations. Genes under selection were spread across the genome, and there were no large regions of increased differentiation as expected when selection occurs within just a single generation due to panmixia. This supports the conclusion that most of the genome is homogenized by gene ﬂow that removes any effects of diversifying selection from each new generation.},

	abstract = {European eels (Anguilla anguilla) spawn in the remote Sargasso Sea in partial sympatry with American eels (Anguilla rostrata), and juveniles are transported more than 5000 km back to the European and North African coasts. The two species have been regarded as classic textbook examples of panmixia, each comprising a single, randomly mating population. However, several recent studies based on continental samples have found subtle, but significant, genetic differentiation, interpreted as geographical or temporal heterogeneity between samples. Moreover, European and American eels can hybridize, but hybrids have been observed almost exclusively in Iceland, suggesting hybridization in a specific region of the Sargasso Sea and subsequent nonrandom dispersal of larvae. Here, we report the first molecular population genetics study based on analysis of 21 microsatellite loci in larvae of both Atlantic eel species sampled directly in the spawning area, supplemented by analysis of European glass eel samples. Despite a clear East–West gradient in the overlapping distribution of the two species in the Sargasso Sea, we only observed a single putative hybrid, providing evidence against the hypothesis of a wide marine hybrid zone. Analyses of genetic differentiation, isolation by distance, isolation by time and assignment tests provided strong evidence for panmixia in both the Sargasso Sea and across all continental samples of European eel after accounting for the presence of sibs among newly hatched larvae. European eel has declined catastrophically, and our findings call for management of the species as a single unit, necessitating coordinated international conservation efforts.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Populations within a species may experience genetic adaptation to local environmental conditions while individuals may tolerate variation in environmental conditions due to phenotypic plasticity. European eels reproduce in the Sargasso Sea but spend most of their adult life in highly diverse environmental conditions from northern Europe to North Africa. An unresolved question is whether this species constitutes a single panmictic population or if locally adapted subpopulations occur. Here we conclude, based on whole-genome sequencing, that there is a complete absence of genetic differentiation among eels from different parts of Europe and North Africa. Thus, we postulate that European eels must respond to the extremely diverse ecological conditions they inhabit during the postlarval stages by phenotypic plasticity.
          , 
            
              The relative role of genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity is of fundamental importance in evolutionary ecology [M. J. West-Eberhard,
              Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.
              102 (suppl. 1), 6543–6549 (2005)]. European eels have a complex life cycle, including transitions between life stages across ecological conditions in the Sargasso Sea, where spawning occurs, and those in brackish and freshwater bodies from northern Europe to northern Africa. Whether continental eel populations consist of locally adapted and genetically distinct populations or comprise a single panmictic population has received conflicting support. Here we use whole-genome sequencing and show that European eels belong to one panmictic population. A complete lack of geographical genetic differentiation is demonstrated. We postulate that this is possible because the most critical life stages—spawning and embryonic development—take place under near-identical conditions in the Sargasso Sea. We further show that within-generation selection, which has recently been proposed as a mechanism for genetic adaptation in eels, can only marginally change allele frequencies between cohorts of eels from different geographic regions. Our results strongly indicate plasticity as the predominant mechanism for how eels respond to diverse environmental conditions during postlarval stages, ultimately solving a long-standing question for a classically enigmatic species.},

	abstract = {Selection on standing genetic variation may be effective enough to allow for adaptation to distinct niche environments within a single generation. Minor allele frequency changes at multiple, redundant loci of small effect can produce remarkable phenotypic shifts. Yet, demonstrating rapid adaptation via polygenic selection in the wild remains challenging. Here we harness natural replicate populations that experience similar selection pressures and harbor high within-, yet negligible among-population genetic variation. Such populations can be found among the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus that inhabits marine estuaries characterized by high environmental heterogeneity. We identify 10,861 single nucleotide polymorphisms in F. heteroclitus that belong to a single, panmictic population yet reside in environmentally distinct niches (one coastal basin and three replicate tidal ponds). By sampling at two time points within a single generation, we quantify both allele frequency change within as well as spatial divergence among niche subpopulations. We observe few individually signiﬁcant allele frequency changes yet ﬁnd that the “number” of moderate changes exceeds the neutral expectation by 10–100\%. We ﬁnd allele frequency changes to be signiﬁcantly concordant in both direction and magnitude among all niche subpopulations, suggestive of parallel selection. In addition, within-generation allele frequency changes generate subtle but signiﬁcant divergence among niches, indicative of local adaptation. Although we cannot distinguish between selection and genotype-dependent migration as drivers of within-generation allele frequency changes, the trait/s determining ﬁtness and/or migration likelihood appear to be polygenic. In heterogeneous environments, polygenic selection and polygenic, genotypedependent migration offer conceivable mechanisms for within-generation, local adaptation to distinct niches.},

Given the polygenic basis of most phenotypic traits, quantitative genetic theory predicts that selection is expected to cause subtle allelic changes among covarying loci rather than pronounced changes at few loci of large effects. The goal of this study was to test for the occurrence of polygenic selection in both North Atlantic eels (European Eel, Anguilla anguilla and American Eel, A. rostrata), using a method that searches for covariation among loci that would discriminate eels from ‘control’ vs. ‘polluted’ environments and be associated with speciﬁc contaminants acting as putative selective agents. RAD-seq libraries resulted in 23 659 and 14 755 ﬁltered loci for the European and American Eels, respectively. A total of 142 and 141 covarying markers discriminating European and American Eels from ‘control’ vs. ‘polluted’ sampling localities were obtained using the Random Forest algorithm. Distance-based redundancy analyses (db-RDAs) were used to assess the relationships between these covarying markers and concentration of 34 contaminants measured for each individual eel. PCB153, 4040DDE and selenium were associated with covarying markers for both species, thus pointing to these contaminants as major selective agents in contaminated sites. Gene enrichment analyses suggested that sterol regulation plays an important role in the differential survival of eels in ‘polluted’ environment. This study illustrates the power of combining methods for detecting signals of polygenic selection and for associating variation of markers with putative selective agents in studies aiming at documenting the dynamics of selection at the genomic level and particularly so in human-altered environments.},

The exploration of such relationships first requires the identification of associations between molecular markers and phenotypes. Here, we explore the use of Random Forest (RF), a powerful machine-learning algorithm, in genomic studies to discern loci underlying both discrete and quantitative traits, particularly when studying wild or nonmodel organisms. RF is becoming increasingly used in ecological and population genetics because, unlike traditional methods, it can efficiently analyse thousands of loci simultaneously and account for nonadditive interactions. However, understanding both the power and limitations of Random Forest is important for its proper implementation and the interpretation of results. We therefore provide a practical introduction to the algorithm and its use for identifying associations between molecular markers and phenotypes, discussing such topics as data limitations, algorithm initiation and optimization, as well as interpretation. We also provide short R tutorials as examples, with the aim of providing a guide to the implementation of the algorithm. Topics discussed here are intended to serve as an entry point for molecular ecologists interested in employing Random Forest to identify trait associations in genomic data sets.},

The result is a short period of approximately 3 days during which the skies of Johannesburg are filled with white butterflies, a spectacle that has been recorded in print media over the past century, and social media over the past decade. In this study, we mine these traditional and social media archives to produce the first multi-decadal phenological record of butterfly migration timing for South Africa, and explore the changes in timing and the role of climate thereof. We find a statistically significant advance in timing at a rate of 2.9 days per decade (r = 0.34, p = 0.0490). The climatic drivers of shifts in migratory species arrival are difficult to detect, as they involve the role of weather at the point of departure in determining the start of flight, and the weather en route to determine the path followed. However, statistically significant relationships are found between the arrival dates and both Tmin and precipitation in the month of December, and the combination thereof (r = 0.44, p = 0.0437 and r = 0.45, p = 0.0420 respectively). The findings of this study contribute to a growing literature documenting phenological shifts in South Africa, a previously under-represented region.},

Here, we present the hypothesis that outbreaking insects can sometimes transport consequential amounts of embodied nutrients over long distances, thereby connecting ecological dynamics across space and leading to potential emergent effects at the landscape scale that have not been specifically addressed heretofore. Based on previously published data on insect population density, individual body mass, and nutrient content, we present initial quantitative estimates of nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes for various outbreaking insect species in different ecosystems. The results suggest that during the phases of major population change within an outbreak cycle, this process may transfer, over a given area, amounts of nutrients that exceed annual input from contemporaneous levels of atmospheric deposition, particularly for phosphorus. In addition, the relative strength of the process was likely even higher in the preindustrial era, especially for nitrogen, due to a weaker anthropogenic influence on atmospheric deposition at that time. The values we have found are comparable to the results from previous studies on 2-D­ nutrient fluxes by other animals and that have been considered consequential for ecosystem processes. We further illustrate the implications of the process for the spatial distribution of nutrients and resulting ecological complexity and argue that the process is inherently scale dependent, contrary to vertical fluxes like atmospheric deposition. Moreover, we provide suggestions for future studies, both empirical and theoretical, that would better quantify the strength of the process and assess its implications. Given that the productivity of most natural terrestrial ecosystems depends primarily on locally recycled nutrients and that spatial source–sink nutrient dynamics has been shown to have important ecological consequences, the long-­distance lateral transfer of nutrients by outbreaking insects appears like a relevant landscape-­level process worthwhile of more specific attention.},

To address this, we conducted whole-genome resequencing of 175 tarakihi from around New Zealand and Tasmania (Australia) to obtain a dataset of 7.5 million genome-wide and high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Allele frequencies from 55 loci were associated with at least one of six environmental variables, of which 47 correlated strongly with yearly mean water temperature. Although genes associated with these loci are linked to various functions, the most common functions were integral components of membrane and cilium assembly. Projection of the RDA indicates the existence of a latitudinal temperature cline. Our work provides the first genomic insights supporting panmixia of tarakihi in New Zealand and evidence of a genomic cline that appears to be driven by the temperature gradients, together providing crucial information to inform the stock assessment of this species, and to widen the insights of the ecological drivers of adaptive variation in a marine species.},

In preliminary analyses using common pipelines for handling, filtering and processing genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data from three aquatic bird species, we detected a bias likely associated to the sex of individuals of the genus Sula, which could be due to artifacts with sex chromosome derived reads. Thus, we have developed GBirdS, a new pipeline for avian population genetics from GBS data, implementing a new approach to identify molecular markers likely to be linked to the avian W chromosome. The pipeline was applied to a total of 113 samples from three avian species (Sula leucogaster, Sula dactylatra and Mergus octosetaceus), including 54 samples for which the molecular sexing was available. For 53 out of these 54 samples, the sex determination achieved using GBirdS agreed with molecular sexing. We have then removed from subsequent population analyses the sequences observed only in individuals determined as heterogametic (likely to be females) by our pipeline. Removing these sequences resulted in greater average fixation indexes between subpopulations of these three species. Therefore, we conclude that the sequences removed by our pipeline had an artificial effect on interindividual differences and population structure.},

	abstract = {Studying the isotope variability in fast-growing human tissues (e.g., hair, nails) is a powerful tool to investigate human nutrition. However, interpreting the controls of this isotopic variability at the population scale is often challenging as multiple factors can superimpose on the isotopic signals of a current population. Here, we analyse carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur isotopes in hair from 590 Canadian resident volunteers along with demographics, dietary and geographic information about each participant. We use a series of machine-learning regressions to demonstrate that the isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair are not only influenced by dietary choices but by geographic controls. First, we show that isotopic values in Canadian residents’ hair have a limited range of variability consistent with the homogenization of Canadian dietary habits (as in other industrialized countries). As expected, some of the isotopic variability within the population correlates with recorded individual dietary choices. More interestingly, some regional spatial patterns emerge from carbon and sulphur isotope variations. The high carbon isotope composition of the hair of eastern Canadians relative to that of western Canadians correlates with the dominance of corn in the eastern Canadian food-industry. The gradient of sulphur isotope composition in Canadian hair from coast to inland regions correlates with the increasing soil pH and decreasing deposition of marine-derived sulphate aerosols in local food systems. We conclude that part of the isotopic variability found in the hair of Canadian residents reflects the isotopic signature associated with specific environmental conditions and agricultural practices of regional food systems transmitted to humans through the high consumption rate of intra-provincial food in Canada. Our study also underscores the strong potential of sulphur isotopes as tracers of human and food provenance.},

            Summary: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.

One consequence of such sequencing data explosion is the increasing cost and complexity of data processing. The preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter contamination, filtering low‐quality reads, and correcting wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable but resource intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore, although a lot of software applications have been developed to solve this problem, bioinformatics scientists and engineers are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy‐efficient software. Several years ago, the author developed fastp, which is an ultrafast all‐in‐one FASTQ data preprocessor with many modern features. This software has been approved by many bioinformatics users and has been continuously maintained and updated. Since the first publication on fastp, it has been greatly improved, making it even faster and more powerful. For instance, the duplication evaluation module has been improved, and a new deduplication module has been added. This study aimed to introduce the new features of fastp and demonstrate how it was designed and implemented.},

Migrants feeding on nectar were regularly observed in the oasis of Ouadâne, a stopover site in the western Sahara, Mauritania, in spring 2003 and 2004. Migrant species observed consuming nectar were Eastern/Western Olivaceous Warbler Hippolais pallida/opaca, Orphean Warbler Sylvia hortensis, Common Whitethroat S. communis, Subalpine Warbler S. cantillans, Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and Willow Warbler Ph. trochilus, which took nectar from five tree species (Balanites aegyptiaca, Maerua crassifolia, Capparis decidua, Acacia raddiana, Ziziphus mauritiana). Flowering trees were available throughout the entire presumed migration period and, as well as providing nectar, they attracted many insects.We suggest that the phenology of flowering trees might be crucial for bird migration in spring, and might offer a solution to the phenomenon known as ‘Moreau’s paradox’, i.e. that migrants successfully lay down fuel reserves prior to spring migration during the dry season, when potential resources are thought to be at their lowest.},

            Hundreds of millions of birds reach the Mediterranean islands or Mediterranean coast of Europe every spring after having crossed the Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea. Using data from three small insular stopover sites, we calculated body mass without fuel for 18 trans-Saharan passerine migrants. We subsequently used arrival fuel loads coupled with potential flight range estimates to assess the percentage of birds that are forced to perform an obligatory stopover after crossing the Mediterranean Sea due to fuel depletion. Average arrival fuel loads were among the lowest ever recorded in the Mediterranean region and minimum body mass values recorded for several species were lower than any other individual value reported. The percentage of birds that needed to replenish their energy stores before resuming their northward migration journey varied from 0\% to 50\% depending on the species and locality studied. Based on conservative estimates at least 180 million birds of our study species are expected to migrate through Greece, 14\% of which would not be able to resume their migration without refueling. The significance of small islands and coastal sites in the Mediterranean as obligatory refuelling sites is discussed and their conservation value for migratory birds is highlighted under the perspective of climate change.},

	abstract = {The Sahara Desert is one of the major ecological barriers of the Palearctic-Africa bird migration system. We analysed the behaviour of GPS-tagged booted eagles (Aquila pennata) breeding in Spain and wintering in Tropical Africa, focusing on the Sahara crossing. We searched for anomalous track segments recorded during the desert crossing, ﬁnding that non-directional and/or slow movements occur in 35\% of the migratory journeys and last up to 31 days (average: 5.9). The analyses show that this behaviour is not triggered by adverse weather conditions, and is shown especially by females during spring. The length of the stopping periods affects the arrival date to the breeding grounds only in males, which means that females buffer the potential delay with an earlier migration start, suggesting that this behaviour is followed deliberately. These wandering movements occur in hyper-arid areas without vegetation cover. A similar behaviour has not been previously recorded in any other trans-Saharan raptor and is probably related to the ability of booted eagles to take advantage of food resources unexploited by other predators, such as migratory songbirds stopping in the desert during the day, and migratory locusts. If conﬁrmed by further research involving higher resolution tracking and ﬁeld observations, our ﬁndings may show a new way of combining foraging and migration, without a well-deﬁned directed trajectory, nor stopping in a restricted spot, but instead wandering over wide areas.},

Although in some studies, the relationships between migration distance and breeding success or annual survival are established, none has investigated whether mortality during the actual migration increases with migration distance. Here, we compared seasonal survival between Eurasian spoonbills (
              Platalea leucorodia leucorodia

On the basis of resightings of individually marked birds throughout the year between 2005 and 2012, we show that summer, autumn and winter survival were very high and independent of migration distance, whereas mortality during spring migration was much higher (18\%) for the birds that wintered in Mauritania, compared with those flying only as far as France (5\%) or Iberia (6\%). As such, this study is the first to show empirical evidence for increased mortality during some long migrations, likely driven by the presence of a physical barrier (the Sahara desert) in combination with suboptimal fuelling and unfavourable weather conditions

	abstract = {Seasonal migration is intrinsically connected to the balance of survival and reproduction, but whether migratory behavior influences species’ position on the slow-fast continuum of life history is poorly understood. We found that boreal-breeding birds that migrate long distances exhibit higher annual adult survival and lower annual reproductive investment relative to co-distributed boreal species that migrate shorter distances to winter closer to their breeding grounds. Our study uses “vital rates” data on reproductive output and survivorship compiled from the literature for a species assemblage of 45 species of mostly passerine birds. These species breed sympatrically in North American boreal forests but migrate to a diversity of environments for the northern winter. After controlling for body size and phylogeny, migration distance and apparent annual adult survival are positively related across species. Both migration distance and survival are positively correlated with wintering in environments that are warmer, wetter, and greener. At the same time, longer migrations are associated with reduced time spent on the breeding grounds, lower clutch sizes, and lower fecundity (clutch size × maximum number of broods per year). Although seasonal migration is often associated with high mortality, our results suggest that long-distance migration imposes selection pressures that both confer and demand high adult survival rates. That is, owing to the reproductive cost of long-distance migration, this strategy can only persist if balanced by high adult survival. Our study supports the idea that migration evolves to promote survival of species breeding in seasonal environments. In boreal birds, the evolution of the longest migrations yields the highest survival, but at an inherent cost to annual fecundity. Our results therefore reveal migratory distance as a fundamental axis of the slow-fast continuum that predicts, and is inextricable from, the balance of survival and reproduction.},

            The shortest possible migratory route for birds is not always the best route to travel. Substantial research effort has established that birds in captivity are capable of orienting toward the direction of an intended goal, but efforts to examine how free-living birds use navigational information under conditions that potentially make direct flight toward that goal inefficient have been limited in spatiotemporal scales and in the number of individuals observed because of logistical and technological limitations. Using novel and recently developed techniques for analysis of Doppler polarimetric weather surveillance radar data, we examined two impediments for nocturnally migrating songbirds in eastern North America following shortest-distance routes: crosswinds and oceans. We found that migrants in flight often drifted sideways on crosswinds, but most strongly compensated for drift when near the Atlantic coast. Coastal migrants’ tendency to compensate for wind drift also increased through the night, while no strong temporal differences were observed at inland sites. Such behaviors suggest that birds migrate in an adaptive way to conserve energy by assessing while airborne the degree to which they must compensate for wind drift.},

Migrating longer distances is usually expected to be costlier in terms of time, energy expenditure and risks with potential repercussions for subsequent stages within the annual cycle. Such costs are expected to be balanced by increased survival, for example due to higher quality wintering areas or lower energy expenditure at lower latitudes. We compared reproductive parameters and apparent survival of lesser black-backed gulls (
              Larus fuscus
              ) breeding in The Netherlands, whose winter range extends from the UK to West Africa, resulting in one-way migration distances that differ by more than 4500 km. Individuals migrating furthest arrived later in the colony than shorter distance migrants, but still laid in synchrony with the colony and consequently had a shorter pre-laying period. This shorter pre-laying period affected neither egg volumes nor hatching success. We found no relationship between migration distance and apparent survival probability, corresponding with previous research showing that annual energy expenditure and distance travelled throughout the year is similar across migration strategies. Combined, our results indicate an equal fitness payoff across migration strategies, suggesting there is no strong selective pressure acting on migration strategy within this population.},

	abstract = {A common migratory pattern in birds is that northerly breeding populations migrate to more southerly non-breeding sites compared to southerly breeding populations (leap-frog migration). Not only do populations experience differences in migration distances, but also different environmental conditions, which may vary spatiotemporally within their annual cycles, creating distinctive selective pressures and migratory strategies. Information about such adaptations is important to understand migratory drivers and evolution of migration patterns. We use light-level geolocators and citizen science data on regional spring arrivals to compare two populations of common ringed plover Charadrius hiaticula breeding at different latitudes. We (1) describe and characterize the annual cycles and (2) test predictions regarding speed and timing of migration. The northern breeding population (NBP) wintered in Africa and the southern (SBP) mainly in Europe. The annual cycles were shifted temporally so that the NBP was always later in all stages. The SBP spent more than twice as long time in the breeding area, but there was no difference in winter. The NBP spent more time on migration in general. Spring migration speed was lower in the SBP compared to autumn speed of both populations, and there was no difference in autumn and spring speed in the NBP. We also found a larger variation in spring arrival times across years in the SBP. This suggests that a complex interaction of population specific timing and variation of breeding onset, length of breeding season, and proximity to the breeding area shape the annual cycle and migratory strategies.},

For certain species, the interaction between migrant adults and individual host plants is well-studied under laboratory conditions, but scant knowledge exists on the nutritional ecology of wild (i.e., field-caught) moths. During 2017–2018, we trapped adults of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) along its migration pathway in northeastern China and used pollen grain analysis to assess its visitation of particular host plants. Next, we assessed life history effects of adult feeding on carbohydrate-rich resources, for migrant individuals. Pollen grain analysis revealed H. armigera visitation of 32 species from 28 families, with the largest carrier ratio for northward migrants. Evening primrose (Oenothera spp.) accounted for 48\% of pollen grains, indicating a marked H. armigera feeding preference. Furthermore, feeding on sugar-rich foods benefited adult fitness, enhanced fecundity by 65–82\% and increased flight distance by 38–55\% as compared to unfed individuals. Also, the degree of enhancement of reproduction and flight performance following sugar feeding varied between different migratory cohorts. Our work combines (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-assisted) palynology and laboratory-based life history trials to generate novel perspectives on the nutritional ecology of long-distance migratory insects. These findings can aid the development of population monitoring and ‘area-wide’ management strategies for a globally-important agricultural pest.},

The greatest rate of seasonal switching occurred in the tropics. Several species showed extreme range fluctuations between seasons, exceeding 10-­fold for 53 species (13\%) and more than 100-­fold for nine species (2\%), suggesting that such species may be at elevated extinction risk.

	abstract = {Twice a year, songbirds breeding in the Western Palaearctic cross the largest desert of the world, the Sahara, to reach their African winter quarters. Recently, a radar study quantified this migration and demonstrated that almost all passerines cross the western Sahara with an intermittent strategy, i.e. they fly during the night and rest during the day. Before crossing the desert, most passerines accumulate fat stores because they will not find appropriate resting sites for feeding in the Sahara. However, it has also been reported that birds use the vegetation around oases for refuelling. Since birds resting at oases had smaller fat deposits than birds resting in the open desert, it was hypothesised that mainly lean birds or fall-outs use the oases for feeding. In this study, we investigated which species or individuals use oases in the western Sahara during spring migration and how they use them. We demonstrate that a minority of species adapted to dry vegetation may cross the Sahara with low energy stores and intermittent refuelling in vegetation patches. These birds avoid the costs of transporting large energy stores, in contrast to most other passerine migrants which fuel up before crossing the Sahara and adopt an intermittent strategy without refuelling. The birds which rely on refuelling at oases probably often have a slow refuelling rate and may even run the risk of not finding appropriate habitats. The available studies reveal that birds use a wide variety of strategies to cross the Sahara. The particular strategy adopted depends on the species, and is modulated according to weather conditions aloft at the time, existing energy stores, the availability of stopover sites, and the suitability (food availability, competitors) of stopover sites.},

	abstract = {Some authors suggested that there is no single optimal trans-Saharan migratory strategy, but possibly a variety of strategies, including: non-stop, stopover carrying minimal fat but with frequent refuelling, stopover without refuelling. Migrants, indeed, cannot refuel when crossing the Sahara, the only opportunities being the oases scattered in the desert. The presence of such large numbers of birds in oases or "islands" and "corridors" of vegetation in the middle of the desert implies the need to ensure a no risk stop. The authors carried out four visits in the desert areas of Libya, finding that areas covered by vegetation are more important for diurnal migrant birds in spring than in autumn. When, in autumn, birds reach the desert, they have not cov- ered many kilometres and still store a good amount of subcutaneous fat, acquired dur- ing the Mediterranean crossing, whereas in spring they reach oases and other vegetat- ed "islands" in the middle of the desert, after a long flight and may find themselves with scarce fat supplies; this is in line with the high availability of insects in desert areas with vegetation in spring and scarcity in autumn. Assuming the high importance for migratory birds of the above mentioned areas of vegetation scattered throughout the Libyan desert and the presence of "oases" in the Sahara desert, the long term conservation of these areas should be ensured to protect birds breeding in Europe and wintering in Africa. This would obviously cross the borders of individual countries' interests and authorities. Very few desert sites are listed as Important Bird Areas, and the authors therefore propose to include among them Germa lakes and Waw el Namus in the Libyan desert. Evidence for the degradation of staging sites on either side of the Sahara suggests that conservation plans are needed which take into account the needs of migrant birds; oases and new areas of irrigation may pro- vide increasingly important feeding stations during bird migrations, resembling islands within a desert sea; countries involved should assume their international responsibili- ties in bird conservation; European countries, in turn, could invest in research projects and ecological restoration programs in African desert areas.},

Long flight distances thus suggest that individuals need large amounts of space for their body size, resulting in the prediction that species with long flight distances should have a higher frequency of declining populations than species with short flight distances, when human impact on natural habitats increases. Bird species with long flight distances had declining population trends across Europe in a comparative study of 56 species, even when controlling statistically for other factors associated with population declines, with effect sizes ranging from 0.36 to 0.58 (Pearson's r). These findings suggest that standardized measures of flight distance provide reliable information about the population consequences of risk-taking behavior by individuals and the susceptibility of different species to increased levels of disturbance.

1
The desert locust Schistocerca gregaria has been considered a major pest since ancient times, as locust swarms holding millions of insects move throughout the Sahel, northern Africa, Middle East and southern Mediterranean countries. Most research has focused on the biology of the species and the development of strategies in locust control, but little is known about the place of locust pulses within food webs in which domestic herbivores and European long-distance migratory birds are also involved.

2
We evaluated the role of desert locust outbreaks in the food webs of the Sahelian region. We analysed the potential resource competition with domestic herbivores and the response of a generalist predator by assessing its diet and foraging behaviour in relation to the availability of locusts.

3
Stable isotope analyses revealed that little trophic overlap exists between desert locusts that feed on trees and shrubs and nomadic livestock that feed on grasses in the Sahelian savanna grasslands. These results suggest low resource competition with the main human resources in regions with little agricultural development. In addition, during an outbreak that occurred in winter, desert locusts were consumed by resident and long-distance migrant birds. This accounted for significant changes in the diet and foraging strategies of wintering generalist predators such as the black kite Milvus migrans.

4
Synthesis and applications. Our results raise questions about the need for spraying locust swarms in areas where economic losses are scant and wintering populations of European trans-Saharan migrant birds are high. A deeper insight into the ecological and economical role of these outbreaks is urgently needed, together with a reassessment of desert locust control in the Sahel.},

Based on their distribution characteristics, invasion patterns, and breeding success, there are six well-defined categories of Odonata: widespread species - (1) permanently living in the desert, and desert biased, (2) permanently living in the desert, but not desert-biased; (3) entering the desert seasonally; (4) entering from neighbouring tropical or temperate regions, whose populations may breed in the desert sometimes or locally. Category (5) consists of species with highly localised breeding populations in the desert, which are widely isolated from potential source populations. The last category (6) consists of species restricted to allochthonous perennial rivers. We discuss these patterns from a geographical and a temporal perspective.

In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that oviposition behaviour and life-history traits also differ between these two guarding types. Therefore, we studied oviposition behaviour and life-history traits in six species of a dragonfly assemblage of the Namib Desert. Among the oviposition behaviours, oviposition duration and number of pond changes differed significantly between the guarding types. Clutch size did not differ between the guarding types, whereas some offspring characters, namely egg width, temperature sum to hatch, and larval head width, differed between the guarding types. Eggs of tandem species (those performing contact guarding) were larger, which might explain differences in all other offspring characters studied; bigger eggs need a lower temperature sum for egg development, result in bigger larvae, and have a faster growth rate, all traits that might be seen as an adapation to temporary waters, which are major habitats of the tandem species. This observation is discussed in the light of different dispersal strategies between the species performing different guarding types.},

Dragonﬂies that occur in hot arid regions often occur in temporary waters and consequently perform direct and rapid development. Dragonﬂy species of the Namibian desert do diﬀer in their selection of habitats along the HPG and therefore may also diﬀer in life cycle. Here, we attempt to monitor colonisation, larval growth and emergence in a temporary pond of known history. We studied the development of dragonﬂy species that laid eggs in artiﬁcial ponds constructed by us in March 2001. The assemblage consisted of species that originate from diﬀerent habitats along the HPG. To obtain data on larval development we took samples from the ponds at 10-day intervals. Most species showed rapid development. By regressing the maximum sizes attained by larvae on each sampling date against time we estimated growth rates for ﬁve species and were thereby able to estimate that total duration of development from oviposition to emergence ranged between 38 and 70 days. Observation of ﬁrst oviposition and ﬁrst emergence for three of these species corroborated our estimates based on growth rate. Of few species, which laid eggs in the ponds no larvae or adults were found. For some this may have been the result of predation whereas others may not have grown fast enough to emerge before the ponds dried up. Our results indicate that dragonﬂies cannot recognise whether a pond will retain water long enough for full larval development and oviposit in waters that will not allow larval development.},

Variational methods pose the problem of computing relevant posterior distributions as an optimization problem, allowing us to build on recent advances in optimization theory to develop fast inference tools. In addition, we propose useful heuristic scores to identify the number of populations represented in a data set and a new hierarchical prior to detect weak population structure in the data. We test the variational algorithms on simulated data and illustrate using genotype data from the CEPH–Human Genome Diversity Panel. The variational algorithms are almost two orders of magnitude faster than STRUCTURE and achieve accuracies comparable to those of ADMIXTURE. Furthermore, our results show that the heuristic scores for choosing model complexity provide a reasonable range of values for the number of populations represented in the data, with minimal bias toward detecting structure when it is very weak.

Here, we use whole-genome resequencing of both allopatric and hybridizing populations of the European (Phylloscopus collybita abietinus) and the Siberian chiffchaff (P. tristis)—two recently diverged species which differ in morphology, plumage, song, habitat, and migration—to quantify the regional variation in genome-wide genetic diversity and differentiation, and to identify candidate regions for trait variation. We ﬁnd that the levels of diversity, differentiation, and divergence are highly heterogeneous, with signiﬁcantly reduced global differentiation, and more pronounced differentiation peaks in sympatry than in allopatry. This pattern is consistent with regional differences in effective population size and recurrent background selection or selective sweeps reducing the genetic diversity in speciﬁc regions prior to lineage divergence, but the data also suggest that postdivergence selection has resulted in increased differentiation and ﬁxed differences in speciﬁc regions. We ﬁnd that hybridization and backcrossing is common in sympatry, and that phenotype is a poor predictor of the genomic composition of sympatric birds. The combination of a differentiation scan approach with identiﬁcation of ﬁxed differences pinpoint a handful of candidate regions that might be important for trait variation between the two species.},

We sequenced 518 whole genomes from altitudinal transects and found many regions differentiated between highland ({\textasciitilde} 1200 m) and lowland ({\textasciitilde} 200 m) populations. We show repeated genetic differentiation across replicate populations within species, including allopatric comparisons. In contrast, there is little molecular parallelism between the two species. By sampling five close relatives, we find that a large proportion of divergent regions identified within species have arisen from standing variation and putative adaptive introgression from high-altitude specialist species. Taken together our study supports a role for both standing genetic variation and gene flow from independently adapted species in promoting parallel local adaptation to the environment.},

            Under the neutral theory, genetic diversity is expected to increase with population size. While comparative analyses have consistently failed to find strong relationships between census population size and genetic diversity, a recent study across animals identified a strong correlation between propagule size and genetic diversity, suggesting that r-strategists that produce many small offspring, have greater long-term population sizes. Here we compare genome-wide genetic diversity across 38 species of European butterflies (Papilionoidea), a group that shows little variation in reproductive strategy. We show that genetic diversity across butterflies varies over an order of magnitude and that this variation cannot be explained by differences in current abundance, propagule size, host or geographic range. Instead, neutral genetic diversity is negatively correlated with body size and positively with the length of the genetic map. This suggests that genetic diversity is determined both by differences in long-term population size and the effect of selection on linked sites.},

	abstract = {Background  Migratory insects are important for the provision of ecosystem services both at the origin and destination sites but – apart from some iconic species – the migration routes of many insect species have not been assessed. Coastlines serve as a funnel where migrating animals including insects accumulate. Migratory behaviour and captures of dragonflies in bird traps suggest autumn migration of dragonflies along coastlines while the origin and regularity of this migration remain unclear.
Methods  Dragonfly species were caught at the bird observatory Kabli at the Baltic coast in Estonia in 2009, 2010 and 2015. For the 2015 data set, we used a stable hydrogen (H) approach to trace the potential natal origin of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta).
Results  1079 (2009), 701 (2010) and 88 (2015) A. mixta individuals were caught during the study periods (35, 37 and 11 days in 2009, 2010 and 2015, respectively). The migration period lasted from end of August to end of September. Based on the results from our stable isotope analysis, we identified two populations of A. mixta: One (range of isotope signatures of non-exchangeable H [δ2Hn wing]: −78‰ to −112‰) had a local likely origin while the other (δ2Hn wing: −113‰ to −147‰) migrated from northerly directions even in headwind from the South. The former showed an even sex ratio whereas the actively migrating population was dominated by males.
Conclusions  Our results suggest a regular southbound autumn migration of A. mixta along the Baltic coast. However, nearly half of the sampled individuals originated from the surroundings suggesting either no, partial or “leap-frog” migration. Contrary to our expectation, A. mixta did not select favourable wind conditions but continued the southbound autumn migration in the flight boundary layer even in case of headwinds. The dominance of males might indicate migration as a result of competition for resources. Further repeated, large-scale studies along the Baltic coast are necessary to pinpoint the migratory pattern and the reason for migration of A. mixta. Such studies should also comprise locations north of the known species range of A. mixta because of the rapid climate-change induced range expansion.},

	abstract = {Combining nuclear (nuDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers has improved the power of molecular data to test phylogenetic and phylogeographic hypotheses and has highlighted the limitations of studies using only mtDNA markers. In fact, in the past decade, many conflicting geographic patterns between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic markers have been identified (i.e. mito-nuclear discordance). Our goals in this synthesis are to: (i) review known cases of mito-nuclear discordance in animal systems, (ii) to summarize the biogeographic patterns in each instance and (iii) to identify common drivers of discordance in various groups. In total, we identified 126 cases in animal systems with strong evidence of discordance between the biogeographic patterns obtained from mitochondrial DNA and those observed in the nuclear genome. In most cases, these patterns are attributed to adaptive introgression of mtDNA, demographic disparities and sex-biased asymmetries, with some studies also implicating hybrid zone movement, human introductions and Wolbachia infection in insects. We also discuss situations where divergent mtDNA clades seem to have arisen in the absence of geographic isolation. For those cases where foreign mtDNA haplotypes are found deep within the range of a second taxon, data suggest that those mtDNA haplotypes are more likely to be at a high frequency and are commonly driven by sex-biased asymmetries and ⁄ or adaptive introgression. In addition, we discuss the problems with inferring the processes causing discordance from biogeographic patterns that are common in many studies. In many cases, authors presented more than one explanation for discordant patterns in a given system, which indicates that likely more data are required. Ideally, to resolve this issue, we see important future work shifting focus from documenting the prevalence of mito-nuclear discordance towards testing hypotheses regarding the drivers of discordance. Indeed, there is great potential for certain cases of mitochondrial introgression to become important natural systems within which to test the effect of different mitochondrial genotypes on whole-animal phenotypes.},

This paper provides a brief review of studies that have used the isotope approach to evaluate changes in diet, isotopic niche, contaminant burden, reproductive and nutritional investment, invasive species and shifts in migration origin or destination with clear links to evaluating effects of global change. This field has now reached a level of maturity that is impressive but generally underappreciated and involves technical as well as statistical advances and access to freely available R-based packages. There is a need for animal ecologists and conservationists to design tissue collection networks that will best answer current and anticipated questions related to the global change and the biodiversity crisis. These developments will move the field of stable isotope ecology toward a more hypothesis driven discipline related to rapidly changing global events.},

In the Pyrenees, prior research has focused on diurnal migratory insects. In this study, we investigate the nocturnal component of the migratory assemblage and ask if this transient food source is also used by bat species. Three seasons of insect trapping revealed 66 species of four different orders, 90\% of which were Noctuid moths, including the destructive pest
              Helicoverpa armigera
              , otherwise known as the cotton bollworm. Acoustic bat detectors revealed that high activity of

	abstract = {Populations are shaped by their history. It is crucial to interpret population structure in an evolutionary context. Pairwise FST measures population structure, whereas population-speciﬁc FST measures deviation from the ancestral population. To understand the current population structure and a population’s history of range expansion, we propose a representation method that overlays population-speciﬁc FST estimates on a sampling location map, and on an unrooted neighbor-joining tree and a multi-dimensional scaling plot inferred from a pairwise FST distance matrix. We examined the usefulness of our procedure using simulations that mimicked population colonization from an ancestral population and by analyzing published human, Atlantic cod, and wild poplar data. Our results demonstrated that population-speciﬁc FST values identify the source population and trace the evolutionary history of its derived populations. Conversely, pairwise FST values represent the current population structure. By integrating the results of both estimators, we obtained a new picture of the population structure that incorporates evolutionary history. The generalized least squares estimate of genome-wide population-speciﬁc FST indicated that the wild poplar population expanded its distribution to the north, where daylight hours are long in summer, to coastal areas with abundant rainfall, and to the south where summers are dry. Genomic data highlight the power of the bias-corrected moment estimators of FST, whether global, pairwise, or population-speciﬁc, that provide unbiased estimates of FST. All FST moment estimators described in this paper have reasonable processing times and are useful in population genomics studies.},

                  Empirical studies have shown a positive relationship between migration and fecundity, suggesting a ‘migration syndrome’ that also includes delayed reproduction and an extended reproductive lifespan. At the same time, life history theory predicts that the cost of migration should result in lower fecundity because both traits draw from a common resource.
                
                
                  
                    We test whether migration is associated with higher fecundity and delayed reproduction in five closely related butterfly species in the Nymphalini tribe. Two of these are migratory,
                    Vanessa cardui
                    and
                    Vanessa atalanta
                    , and three are non‐migratory,
                    Aglais urticae
                    ,
                    Aglais io
                    , and
                    Polygonia c‐album
                    , which appears in a diapausing and a non‐diapausing generation.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Laboratory experiment of this study demonstrated a higher lifetime fecundity in the non‐migratory species
                    A. urticae
                    and
                    A. io
                    , compared with the migratory species. When reproductive output was measured in terms of egg mass over adult female mass, also the non‐migratory species
                    P. c‐album
                    had a higher reproductive investment than the two migratory species, and the non‐diapausing generation had a higher reproductive output than the diapausing generation. All species but
                    P. c‐album
                    delayed reproduction until 5–7 days after eclosion/emergence.
                  
                
                
                  These results indicate that a migratory lifestyle carries a reproductive cost and suggests that the migratory habit has not resulted in selection for higher fecundity. However, the migratory species are highly fecund in a wider phylogenetic perspective, which leads to the conclusion that rather than selection having selected for high fecundity and delayed reproduction, these traits may be prerequisites for evolving a migratory lifestyle.},

	abstract = {Physiological traits are often used for vulnerability assessments of organismal responses to climate change. Trait values can change dramatically over the life cycle of organisms but are typically assessed at a single developmental stage. Reconciling ontogenetic changes in physiological traits with vulnerability assessments often reveals early life-stage vulnerabilities. The degree to which ontogenetic changes in physiological traits are due to changes in body mass over development versus stagespecific responses determines the degree to which mass can be used as a proxy for vulnerability. Here, we use the painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, to test ontogenetic changes in two physiological traits, the acute thermal sensitivity of routine metabolic rate (RMR Q10) and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax). RMR Q10 generally followed ontogenetic changes in body mass, with stages characterized by smaller body mass exhibiting lower acute thermal sensitivity. However, CTmax was largely decoupled from ontogenetic changes in body mass. In contrast with trends from other studies showing increasing vulnerability among progressively earlier developmental stages, our study revealed highly erratic patterns of vulnerability across ontogeny. Specifically, we found the lowest joint-trait vulnerability (both RMR Q10 and CTmax) in the earliest developmental stage we tested (3rd instar larvae), the highest vulnerabilities in the next two developmental stages (4th and 5th instar larvae), and reduced vulnerability into the pupal and adult stages. Our study supports growing evidence of mechanistic decoupling of physiology across developmental stages and suggests that body mass is not a universal proxy for all physiological trait indicators of climate vulnerability.},

Cinisara is a local cattle breed generally of uniform black color which occasionally presents a particular phenotype, with animals typically display a white band along their spine, from the head to the tail, and on the ventral line (color sidedness). Therefore, this breed provides an ideal model to study the genetic components underlying phenotypic variation in coat color. A total of 63 animals, ten with sidedness phenotype and 53 with uniform black color were genotyped with Illumina Bovine 50 K. The comparison among genome-wide association study and FST analysis revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), ARS-BFGL-NGS-55928, signiﬁcantly associated with the trait. Only one gene (PLK2) was annotated near the associated SNP in a window of ± 200 kb. The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the polo-like kinases, the same family of several known coat-color candidate genes. Based on the reported results, we draw the possible conclusion that the identiﬁed marker is potentially associated with the coat color sidedness in Cinisara. The local breeds with their genetic variability represent an important resource and model to study the genetic basis aﬀecting peculiar traits. Future studies would be particularly relevant to reﬁne these results and to better understand the genetic basis for this phenotype.},

Adults make migratory flights after emergence, which reduces their effectiveness as biological control agents. Previously, we proved that 2-d-old unmated females exhibited significantly stronger flight ability than 3-d-old ones. Meanwhile, 3-d-old unmated adults flew significantly longer distances than mated ones. In this study, Illumina RNA sequencing was performed to characterize differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between virgin and mated adults of different ages in a single female strain of C. sinica. In total, 713,563,726 clean reads were obtained and de novo assembled into 109,165 unigenes with an average length of 847 bp (N50 of 1,754 bp), among which 4,382 (4.01\%) unigenes matched known proteins. Based on these annotations, many putative transcripts were related to C. sinica’s flight capacity and muscle structure, energy supply, growth, development, environmental adaptability, and metabolism of nutritional components and bioactive components. In addition, the differential expression of transcripts between different ages and mating status were analyzed, and DEGs participating in flight capacity and muscles were detected, including glutathione hydrolase, NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase, aminopeptidase, and acidic amino acid decarboxylase. The DEGs with functions associated with flight capacity and muscles exhibited higher transcript levels for younger (2 d--old) virgins. This comprehensive C. sinica transcriptomic data provide a foundation for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the flight capacity to meet the physiological demands of flight muscles in C. sinica.},

	abstract = {Survival probability is fundamental for understanding population dynamics. Methods for estimating survival probability from ﬁeld data typically require marking individuals, but marking methods are not possible for arthropod species that molt their exoskeleton between life stages. We developed a novel Bayesian state-space model to estimate arthropod larval survival probability from stage-structured count data. We performed simulation studies to evaluate estimation bias due to detection probability, individual variation in stage duration, and study design (sampling frequency and sample size). Estimation of cumulative survival probability from oviposition to pupation was robust to potential sources of bias. Our simulations also provide guidance for designing ﬁeld studies with minimal bias. We applied the model to the monarch butterﬂy (Danaus plexippus), a declining species in North America for which conservation programs are being implemented. We estimated cumulative survival from egg to pupation from monarch counts conducted at 18 ﬁeld sites in three landcover types in Iowa, USA, and Ontario, Canada: road rightof-ways, natural habitats (gardens and restored meadows), and agricultural ﬁeld borders. Mean predicted survival probability across all landcover types was 0.014 (95\% CI: 0.004–0.024), four times lower than previously published estimates using an ad hoc estimator. Estimated survival probability ranged from 0.002 (95\% CI: 7.0EÀ7 to 0.034) to 0.058 (95\% CI: 0.013–0.113) at individual sites. Among landcover types, agricultural ﬁeld borders in Ontario had the highest estimated survival probability (0.025 with 95\% CI: 0.008–0.043) and natural areas had the lowest estimated survival probability (0.008 with 95\% CI: 0.009–0.024). Monarch production was estimated as adults produced per milkweed stem by multiplying survival probabilities by eggs per milkweed at these sites. Monarch production ranged from 1.0 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.68) adult in Ontario natural areas in 2016 to 29.0 (SD = 10.42) adults in Ontario agricultural borders in 2015 per 6809 milkweed stems. Survival estimates are critical to monarch population modeling and habitat restoration efforts. Our model is a signiﬁcant advance in estimating survival probability for monarch butterﬂies and can be readily adapted to other arthropod species with stage-structured life histories.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  In evolutionary ecology, risk-spreading (i.e. bet-hedging) is the idea that unpredictably variable environments favor genotypes with lower variance in fitness at the cost of lower arithmetic mean fitness. Variance in fitness can be reduced by physiology or behavior that spreads risk of encountering an unfavorable environment over time or space. Such risk-spreading can be achieved by a single phenotype that avoids risks (conservative risk-spreading) or by phenotypic variation expressed by a single genotype (diversified risk-spreading). Across these categories, three types of risk-spreading can be usefully distinguished: temporal, metapopulation, and within-generation. Theory suggests that temporal and metapopulation risk-spreading may work under a broad range of population sizes, but within-generation risk-spreading appears to work only when populations are small. Although genetic polymorphisms have sometimes been treated as risk-spreading, the underlying mechanisms are different, and they often require different conditions for their evolution and thus are better treated separately. I review the types of evidence that could be used to test for risk-spreading and discuss evidence for risk-spreading in facultative diapause, migration polyphenism, spatial distribution of oviposition, egg size, and other miscellaneous traits. Although risk-spreading theory is voluminous and well developed in some ways, rarely has it been used to generate detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of risk-spreading. Furthermore, although there is evidence for risk-spreading, particularly in facultative diapause, I have been unable to find any definitive tests with unequivocal results showing that risk-spreading has been a major factor in the evolution of insect behaviors or life histories. To advance our understanding of risk-spreading in the wild, we need (a) explicit empirical models that predict levels of diversifying risk-spreading for several insect populations in several environments that vary in uncertainty, and (b) tests of these models using measurements of phenotypes and their fitnesses over several generations in each environment.},

	abstract = {The Sahara Desert is one of the largest land-based barriers on the Earth, crossed twice each year by billions of birds on migration. Here we investigate how common swifts migrating between breeding sites in Sweden and wintering areas in sub-Saharan Africa perform the desert crossing with respect to route choice, winds, timing and speed of migration by analysing 72 geolocator tracks recording migration. The swifts cross western Sahara on a broad front in autumn, while in spring they seem to use three alternative routes across the Sahara, a western, a central and an eastern route across the Arabian Peninsula, with most birds using the western route. The swifts show slower migration and travel speeds, and make longer detours with more stops in autumn compared with spring. In spring, the stopover period in West Africa coincided with mostly favourable winds, but birds remained in the area, suggesting fuelling. The western route provided more tailwind assistance compared with the central route for our tracked swifts in spring, but not in autumn. The ultimate explanation for the evolution of a preferred western route is presumably a combination of matching rich foraging conditions (swarming insects) and favourable winds enabling fast spring migration.

	abstract = {Billions of songbirds breeding in the Western Palaearctic cross the largest desert of the world, the Sahara, twice a year. While crossing Europe, the vast majority use an intermittent flight strategy, i.e. fly at night and rest or feed during the day. However, it was long assumed that they overcome the Sahara in a 40h non-stop flight. In this study, we observed bird migration with radar in the plain sand desert of the Western Sahara (Mauritania) during autumn and spring migration and revealed a clear prevalence of intermittent migration. Massive departures of songbirds just after sunset independent of site and season suggests strongly that songbirds spent the day in the plain desert. Thus, most songbirds cross the Sahara predominately by the intermittent flight strategy. Autumn migration took place mainly at low altitudes with high temperatures, its density decreased abruptly before sunrise, followed by very little daytime migration. Migration was highly restricted to night-time and matched perfectly the intermittent flight strategy. However, in spring, when migratory flights occurred at much higher altitudes than in autumn, in cool air, about 17\% of the songbird migration occurred during the day. This suggests that flying in high temperatures and turbulent air, as is the case in autumn, may lead to an increase in water and/or energy loss and may prevent songbirds from prolonged flights into the day.},

Removal or degradation of stopover sites in a network might impede movement and thereby reduce migration success and survival. The extent to which the breakdown of migration networks, due to changes in land use, impacts the population sizes of migratory birds is poorly understood. We measured the functional connectivity of migration networks of waterfowl species that migrate over the East Asian-Australasian Flyway from 1992 to 2015. We analysed the relationship between changes in non-breeding population sizes and changes in functional connectivity, while taking into account other commonly considered species traits, using a phylogenetic linear mixed model. We found that population sizes significantly declined with a reduction in the functional connectivity of migration networks; no other variables were important. We conclude that the current decrease in functional connectivity, due to habitat loss and degradation in migration networks, can negatively and crucially impact population sizes of migratory birds. Our findings provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that affect population trends of migratory birds under environmental changes. Establishment of international agreements leading to the creation of systematic conservation networks associated with migratory species' distributions and stopover sites may safeguard migratory bird populations.},

The objective of the current study was to assess whether similar behavior is exhibited by mosquitoes and other insects around the Lake Victoria basin region of Kenya in East Africa. Insects were sampled monthly from dusk to dawn over 1 year using sticky nets suspended on a tethered helium-filled balloon. A total of 17,883 insects were caught on nets tethered at 90, 120, and 160 m above ground level; 818 insects were caught in control nets. Small insects ({\textless}0.5 cm, n = 15,250) were predominant regardless of height compared with large insects ({\textgreater}0.5 cm, n = 2,334) and mosquitoes (n = 299). Seven orders were identified; dipteran was the most common. Barcoding molecular assays of 184 mosquitoes identified 7 genera, with Culex being the most common (65.8\%) and Anopheles being the least common (5.4\%). The survival rate of mosquitoes, experimentally exposed to high-altitude overnight, was significantly lower than controls maintained in the laboratory (19\% vs. 85\%). There were no significant differences in mosquito survival and oviposition rate according to capture height. These data suggest that windborne dispersal activity of mosquito vectors of malaria and other diseases occurs on a broad scale in sub-Saharan Africa.},

          In 1950 David and Elizabeth Lack chanced upon a huge migration of insects and birds flying through the Pyrenean Pass of Bujaruelo, later describing the spectacle as combining both grandeur with novelty. The intervening years have seen many changes to land use and climate, posing the question as to the current status of this migratory phenomenon, while a lack of quantitative data has prevented insights into the ecological impact of this mass insect migration and into the factors affecting it. To address this, we revisited the site in autumn over a 4-year period and systematically monitored diurnal insect species and numbers. We document an annual mean of 17.1 million day-flying insects from 5 orders moving south, with ‘mass migration’ events associated with warmer temperatures, the presence of a headwind, sunlight, low windspeed, and low rainfall. Diptera dominated the migratory assemblage and annual numbers varied by more than fourfold with larger annual migration flows associated with higher autumn temperatures in Northwest Europe. Finally, using observed environmental thresholds for migration, we estimate an annual ‘bioflow’ of at least 14.6 billion day-flying insects migrating south over the whole Pyrenean Mountain range, highlighting the importance of this route for seasonal insect migrants.},

	abstract = {Numerous insects including pests and beneficial species undertake windborne migrations over hundreds of kilometers. In East Asia, climate-­induced changes in large-­scale atmospheric circulation systems are affecting wind-­fields and precipitation zones and these, in turn, are changing migration patterns. We examined the consequences in a serious rice pest, the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens) in East China. BPH cannot overwinter in temperate East Asia, and infestations there are initiated by several waves of windborne spring or summer migrants originating from tropical areas in Indochina. The East Asian summer monsoon, characterized by abundant rainfall and southerly winds, is of critical importance for these northward movements. We analyzed a 42-­year dataset of meteorological parameters and catches of BPH from a standardized network of 341 light-­traps in South and East China. We show that south of the Yangtze River during summer, southwesterly winds have weakened and rainfall increased, while the summer precipitation has decreased further north on the Jianghuai Plain. Together, these changes have resulted in shorter migratory journeys for BPH leaving South China. As a result, pest outbreaks of BPH in the key rice-­growing area of the Lower Yangtze River Valley (LYRV) have declined since 2001. We show that these changes to the East Asian summer monsoon weather parameters are driven by shifts in the position and intensity of the Western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) system that have occurred during the last 20 years. As a result, the relationship between WPSH intensity and BPH immigration that was previously used to predict the size of the immigration to the LYRV has now broken down. Our results demonstrate that migration patterns of a serious rice pest have shifted in response to the climate-­induced changes in precipitation and wind pattern, with significant consequences for the population management of migratory pests.},

	abstract = {Insect migrations represent large movements of resources across a landscape, which are attractive to predators capable of detecting and catching them. Brazilian free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis (I. Geoffroy, 1824)) consume migratory noctuid moths, which concentrate in favourable winds resulting in aggregations of prey that attract bats hundreds of metres above ground. Although T. brasiliensis are known to feed on these aggregations of migratory moths, changes in their foraging behaviours have not been linked to moth migration events. We investigated possible shifts in the bats’ foraging behaviours when moths are migrating with respect to altitude and moth abundance. We recorded 1104 echolocation call passes of T. brasiliensis at ground level and at altitudes of ϳ100 and ϳ200 m above ground level. We found proportionally more bat activity at higher altitudes when migratory moth abundance was high. We also found that bats decreased call frequency and bandwidth and increased call duration at higher altitudes and behaved similarly with increasing moth abundance even at ground level. Our results support predictions that bats change foraging behaviour in response to seasonal availability of migratory moths and document alterations in echolocation call parameters that are consistent with optimizing prey detection.},

	abstract = {Butterfly size can be affected by several external, environmental factors. Some of these factors are temperature, light exposure, and nutrient consumption. Temperature is known to have to have a great impact on the metabolism of invertebrates, speeding up growth and development stages. Metabolic rate can affect the size of butterflies and can result in a hastened metamorphosis phase. However, it is unknown how temperature affects mature Vanessa cardui butterflies, specifically their wingspan length. Here we show how increasing temperature decreases V. cardui wingspan and overall size. Previous research would suggest that our research agrees with the “temperature-size rule” which states that at lower temperatures ectotherms will grow more slowly, but will become larger as adults than individuals that live at warmer temperatures (Angilletta and Dunham, 2003). This study is meant to be a starting point to a much larger discussion involving how temperature could affect other aspects of the organism, such as color, flight patterns, or mating and pollination patterns.},

          Butterfly migration across great distances is testimony to their impressive aeronautical skills. Wing size and shape are two key determinants of flight performance, and in butterflies, the specific configuration of forewings to hindwings including the overlapping area between them can have profound effects on overall size and shape. Here we use quantitative morphometrics to analyze the wing size, shape, and flight performance of 190 exemplar species representing a tribal-level phylogeny of Papilionoidea. We identify three morphological ‘flight systems’ that are characterized by these fore- and hindwing configurations (small [beating], medium, and large [gliding]), and our data suggest that the emergence of these systems coincided with periods of paleoclimatic upheaval. A higher proportion of migratory species have wings characteristic of gliders, and their degree of host specialization appears to be more flexible than that of counterparts with beating wings.},

	abstract = {In animals with complex life cycles, all resources needed to form adult tissues are procured at the larval stage. For butterflies, the proper development of wings involves synthesizing tissue during metamorphosis based on the raw materials obtained by larvae. Similarly, manufacture of pigment for wing scales also requires resources acquired by larvae. We conducted an experiment to test the effects of food deprivation in the larval stage on multiple measures of adult wing morphology and coloration of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), a species in which long-distance migration makes flight efficiency critical. In a captive setting, we restricted food (milkweed) from late-stage larvae for either 24 hrs or 48 hrs, then after metamorphosis we used image analysis methods to measure forewing surface area and elongation (length/ width), which are both important for migration. We also measured the brightness of orange pigment and the intensity of black on the wing. There were correlations between several wing features, including an unexpected association between wing elongation and melanism, which will require further study to fully understand. The clearest effect of food restriction was a reduction in adult wing size in the high stress group (by approximately 2\%). Patterns observed for other wing traits were ambiguous: monarchs in the low stress group (but not the high) had less elongated and paler orange pigmentation. There was no effect on wing melanism. Although some patterns obtained in this study were unclear, our results concerning wing size have direct bearing on the monarch migration. We show that if milkweed is limited for monarch larvae, their wings become stunted, which could ultimately result in lower migration success.},

	abstract = {Migration is a common life-history strategy that includes traits such as directed ﬂight, increased wing size, seasonal lipid deposition and reproductive arrest. The degree of investment in these traits ultimately determines the life-history strategy of individuals. Partial migration is a common mixed life-history strategy where species or populations consist of both migrant and resident individuals. While this phenomenon is widespread across taxa, the ecological factors that select for and maintain partial migration are poorly understood, especially among insects. Here, we investigate regional life-history traits associated with migration in the southern monarch, Danaus erippus, and describe a mixed life-history strategy in this butterﬂy. Individuals from the Bolivian lowlands were observed throughout the year exhibiting mate- and milkweed-directed behaviors. These butterﬂies had smaller wings, lower wing loads and maintained constant lipid and egg loads across summer and autumn months. Danaus erippus in the highlands of the Bolivian Andes were observed only in the summer and autumn months, during which they also showed mate- and milkweed-directed behaviors. These individuals possessed similar-sized wings and maintained similar lipid and egg loads as the lowland butterﬂies. In contrast, individuals from northwest Argentina showed persistent, directed, southwesterly ﬂight during the autumn (March–May), larger wing size, higher wing loads, and increased autumn lipid deposition along with decreased egg production. These data indicate that D. erippus utilizes a mixed life-history strategy with a combination of residents and migrants in the Bolivian lowlands, elevational migrants in the Bolivian Andes, and latitudinal migrants in northwestern Argentina.},

	abstract = {Background: Understanding how past climatic oscillations have affected organismic evolution will help predict the impact that current climate change has on living organisms. The European turtle dove, Streptopelia turtur, is a warm-temperature adapted species and a long distance migrant that uses multiple flyways to move between Europe and Africa. Despite being abundant, it is categorized as vulnerable because of a long-term demographic decline. We studied the demographic history and population genetic structure of the European turtle dove using genomic data and mitochondrial DNA sequences from individuals sampled across Europe, and performing paleoclimatic niche modelling simulations.
Results: Overall our data suggest that this species is panmictic across Europe, and is not genetically structured across flyways. We found the genetic signatures of demographic fluctuations, inferring an effective population size (Ne) expansion that occurred between the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, followed by a decrease in the Ne that started between the mid Holocene and the present. Our niche modelling analyses suggest that the variations in the Ne are coincident with recent changes in the availability of suitable habitat.
Conclusions: We argue that the European turtle dove is prone to undergo demographic fluctuations, a trait that makes it sensitive to anthropogenic impacts, especially when its numbers are decreasing. Also, considering the lack of genetic structure, we suggest all populations across Europe are equally relevant for conservation.},

              took advantage of a chain of small islands in the Caribbean colonized by anole lizards. A series of repeated behavioral selection experiments were set up in which brown anole populations were established with and without predators. On predator-free islands, animals that were more exploratory were favored, whereas when predators were present, less adventurous animals survived better. Selection for behavior occurred simultaneously with morphological selection but was predominant when predators were present.

              Biologists have long debated the role of behavior in evolution, yet understanding of its role as a driver of adaptation is hampered by the scarcity of experimental studies of natural selection on behavior in nature. After showing that individual
              Anolis sagrei
              lizards vary consistently in risk-taking behaviors, we experimentally established populations on eight small islands either with or without
              Leiocephalus carinatus
              , a major ground predator. We found that selection predictably favors different risk-taking behaviors under different treatments: Exploratory behavior is favored in the absence of predators, whereas avoidance of the ground is favored in their presence. On predator islands, selection on behavior is stronger than selection on morphology, whereas the opposite holds on islands without predators. Our field experiment demonstrates that selection can shape behavioral traits, paving the way toward adaptation to varying environmental contexts.},

This pest has a host range of {\textgreater} 80 plant species, but two host strains are recognized based on their association with corn (C-strain) or rice and smaller grasses (R-strain). The population genomics of the United States (USA) fall armyworm remains poorly characterized to date despite its agricultural threat.
Results: In this study, the population structure and genetic diversity in 55 S. frugiperda samples from Argentina, Brazil, Kenya, Puerto Rico and USA were surveyed to further our understanding of whole genome nuclear diversity. Comparisons at the genomic level suggest a panmictic S. frugiperda population, with only a minor reduction in gene flow between the two overwintering populations in the continental USA, also corresponding to distinct host strains at the mitochondrial level. Two maternal lines were detected from analysis of mitochondrial genomes. We found members from the Eastern Hemisphere interspersed within both continental USA overwintering subpopulations, suggesting multiple individuals were likely introduced to Africa.
Conclusions: Our research is the largest diverse collection of United States S. frugiperda whole genome sequences characterized to date, covering eight continental states and a USA territory (Puerto Rico). The genomic resources presented provide foundational information to understand gene flow at the whole genome level among S. frugiperda populations. Based on the genomic similarities found between host strains and laboratory vs. field samples, our findings validate the experimental use of laboratory strains and the host strain differentiation based on mitochondria and sex-linked genetic markers extends to minor genome wide differences with some exceptions showing mixture between host strains is likely occurring in field populations.},

We analysed genetic variation across the genomes of 280 FAW individuals from both the Eastern hemisphere and the Americas. The global range-­wide genetic structure of FAW shows that the FAW in America has experienced deep differentiation, largely consistent with the Z-­chromosomal Tpi haplotypes commonly used to differentiate ‘corn-­strain’ and ‘rice-­strain’ populations. The invasive populations from Africa and Asia are different from the American ones and have a relatively homogeneous population structure, consistent with the common origin and recent spreading from Africa to Asia. Our analyses suggest that north-­and central American ‘corn-­strain’ FAW are the most likely sources of the invasion into the Eastern hemisphere. Furthermore, evidence based on genomic, transcriptomic and mitochondrial haplotype network analyses indicates an earlier, independent introduction of FAW into Africa, with subsequent migration into the recent invasive population.},

Although it is widely accepted that migrants come from North Africa, there is currently a dearth of information on the source areas they originate from. However, in a recent study, a strong association between V. cardui arriving in spring in Catalonia (NE Spain) and synoptic-scale winds originating in North Africa was found, which allowed us to predict the most likely location for the source areas in the Maghreb. In March 2009 we organized an expedition to conﬁrm in situ the occurrence of immature stages and/or emerging adults at one of the hypothetical breeding areas in Morocco. Immatures were found at virtually all the sampled sites, with the maximum abundance being recorded in the Souss valley. Breeding habitats with plenty of thistles and mallows were sufﬁciently common to permit populations of great density to build up. We found a massive emergence site of 1.8 ha with an estimated population of 170,000 larvae, of which 155,000 had successfully pupated, the rest having been parasitised by the wasp Cotesia vanessae. Bird predation of adults was also recorded at this site. Our observations, together with the typical patchy distribution of the ruderal habitats used for breeding, suggest that source populations most frequently originate in small habitat pockets with favourable conditions that allow for high patch occupancy and levels of oviposition.},

We attached light-level geolocators to birds at the edges of this contact zone to provide, to our knowledge, the first direct test of a putative divide using data from individual birds over the entire annual cycle. Coastal thrushes migrated along the west coast to Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras. Some of these birds used multiple wintering sites. Inland thrushes migrated across the Rocky Mountains, through central North America to Colombia and Venezuela. These birds migrated longer distances than coastal birds and performed a loop migration, navigating over the Gulf of Mexico in autumn and around this barrier in spring. These findings support the suggestion that divergent migratory behaviour could contribute to reproductive isolation between migrants, advance our understanding of their non-breeding ecology, and are integral to development of detailed conservation strategies for this group.},

We sequenced COI) gene of 91 samples and 22 COI sequences retrieved from GenBank as representatives of different localities for comparative analysis. We observed a total of 16 haplotypes, of which seven haplotypes were observed in Uttarakhand with intra-species sequence divergence ranges from 0.001 to 0.009. Haplotype (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (π) were comparatively low and averaging 0.635 and 0.002, respectively. The neutrality test, mismatch distribution graph and observed pattern of diversity indices (Hd and π) revealed population expansion. It was further confirmed by the Median Joining Network, which exhibited a star-like topology from the core haplotype, while the Bayesian phylogenetic tree displayed a mixing of haplo­ types from different localities to an identical clade. Haplotype organization in the Bayesian tree and Median Joining Network was not clustered as per their topographical affinity, indicating incomplete lineage sorting and late species population development or colonization in the novel area.},

For assessment of abundance of butterflies, the method of the quantitative account of Lepidoptera for the biogeographical purposes by visual accounting of quantity of the met specimens on a route per unit of time was used. This method, despite many critical remarks for high relativity (inaccuracy), allows gaining an impression about the number of specimens in the particular territory without mass catching and, respectively, extermination of butterflies. The digital camera was used to photo shots. Field observations were made during migration of butterflies from May 25 to June 06, 2019 in the neighborhood of the city and in the city of Vladikavkaz and in Daryalskoe, Zakkinskoe and Digorskoe gorges. The statistical analysis showed that for May and the first week of June the butterflies were widely extended, both in Asian, and in East European parts of Eurasia. The obtained data generally confirm the assumption that penetration of painted lady butterflies on the East European (Russian) plain during spring migrations happens partially through the Caucasus, Central Asia, bending around the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, or over their water area.},

            The mechanisms shaping island biotas are not yet well understood mostly because of a lack of studies comparing eco-evolutionary fingerprints over entire taxonomic groups. Here, we linked community structure (richness, frequency and nestedness) and genetic differentiation (based on mitochondrial DNA) in order to compare insular butterfly communities occurring over a key intercontinental area in the Mediterranean (Italy-Sicily-Maghreb). We found that community characteristics and genetic structure were influenced by a combination of contemporary and historical factors, and among the latter, connection during the Pleistocene had an important impact. We showed that species can be divided into two groups with radically different properties: widespread taxa had high dispersal capacity, a nested pattern of occurrence, and displayed little genetic structure, while rare species were mainly characterized by low dispersal, high turnover and genetically differentiated populations. These results offer an unprecedented view of the distinctive butterfly communities and of the main processes determining them on each studied island and highlight the importance of assessing the phylogeographic value of populations for conservation.},

Here we aim to provide a genetic test for the trans-Saharan corridor model, and predict the location and stability of ecologicalcorridors, by combining phylogeography and palaeoclimatic modelling. The model was the Psammophis schokari (Schokari sand racer) group, fast-moving and widely distributed generalist colubrids occurring mostly in arid and semiarid scrublands. We combined dated phylogenies of mitochondrial and nuclear markers with palaeoclimatic modelling. For the phylogeographic analysis, we used 75 samples of P. schokari and P. aegyptius, and Bayesian and Maximum-Likelihood methods. For the ecological models, we used Maxent over the distribution of P. schokari and West African lineages. Models were projected to past conditions (mid Holocene, Last Glacial Maximum and Last Inter-Glacial) to infer climatic stable areas. Climatic stability was predicted to be mostly restricted to coastal areas and not spatially continuous. A putative temporary trans-Saharan corridor was identiﬁed in Eastern Sahara, with a more stable one along the Atlantic coast. Six parapatric lineages were identiﬁed within P. schokari, four occurring in North Africa. These likely diverged during the Pliocene. The Tamanraset River might have been a vicariant agent. African lineages may have experienced further subsequent diversiﬁcation during the late Pleistocene. The main P. schokari refugia were probably located along the northern margins of the Sahara, allowing its North-to-South colonization. Trans-Saharan corridors seem to have played a role in P. schokari biogeography, allowing colonization of central Saharan mountains and Sahel. Some might have worked as refugia, and even the most stable corridors may have sections working as ﬁlters, depending on each climatic phase. We expect the use of trans-Saharan corridors to decrease for more mesic species or with less dispersal capabilities.},

Although parasitism has occasionally been noted as an important mortality factor for this butterfly, no comprehensive study has quantified and compared its parasitoid complexes in different geographical areas or seasons. In 2009, a year when this butterfly was extraordinarily abundant in the western Palaearctic, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation in larval parasitism in central Morocco (late winter and autumn) and north-east Spain (spring and late summer). The primary parasitoids in the complexes comprised a few relatively specialized koinobionts that are a regular and important mortality factor in the host populations. However, there was a strong seasonal variation in the level of parasitism. In Spain percentage parasitism was more than four times higher in late summer than in spring (77.3\% vs. 18\%), while in Morocco it was five times higher by the end of winter than in the autumn (66.2\% vs. 13.2\%). In both regions the build up of parasitoid populations occurred after V. cardui had bred in the same general area over successive generations, and this may represent a selective force favouring seasonal migration to enemy-free space.},

In wing-dimorphic species, their influence on habitat quality, and on rates of development of the migrant itself, maintains variation in responses to environmental cues determining wing-form and migratory behaviour. Migrants flying above their flight boundary layer rely on winds to disperse them across landscapes in which their habitats are distributed. Patterns of distribution of habitat patches, and the influence of changing windspeeds and direction on the displacements of migrants, result in selection for variation in migratory potential at each migration. In subsequent migrations, this variation and stochastic effects of the winds on groundtracks of individual migrants ensure that their destinations 'sample' the landscapes they travel over. The extent and resolution of this sampling, by which migrants reach favourable habitats, depend on the components of migratory potential, their mode of inheritance, and genetic correlations between them, as well as on the characteristics of the winds on which they travel.},

Model-based coalescent analyses for testing models of population structure pointed to strong genetic connectivity among the world’s mallard population.

Today we understand that new species can diverge while exchanging genes, depending on the strength of disruptive natural selection and the factors that affect the linkage relationships of genes under disruptive selection. This mode of diversiﬁcation—divergence with gene ﬂow—includes sympatric speciation, in which gene exchange occurs since onset of divergence, and secondary contact following a period of geographic isolation, as well as all sorts of situations in which gene ﬂow happens intermittently. In recent years, statistical tools have been developed that can reveal the action of gene ﬂow during divergence. Isolation-with-migration (IM) models include parameters for population size, time of population separation, and gene exchange, and they have been used extensively to estimate levels of gene exchange. A survey of studies that have used these models shows that a plurality ﬁnd little evidence of gene ﬂow; however, many report nonzero gene exchange.},

Circumstantial evidence suggests that this insect is a wind-borne migrant, and the weather before and during some of these invasions was examined. Although most invasions studied took place south of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone, for the first time evidence is presented suggesting that migration also takes place to the north of this zone. Immigrants were captured at the invaded sites only when light winds or calms were present. This cannot, however, be used as proof that S. damnosum migrates and lands only where winds are light or it is calm because host-seeking is inhibited by high winds and the time of arrival, as opposed to capture on a host, is unknown. Until the factors initiating emigration, as well as the height, duration and number of flights in each gonotrophic cycle and the time of immigration are known, the present findings cannot be tested rigorously nor can wind records be used to trace the source of immigrants.},

            The conservation of long‐distance migratory birds requires coordination between the multiple countries connected by the movements of these species. The recent expansion of tracking studies is shedding new light on these movements, but much of this information is fragmented and inaccessible to conservation practitioners and policy makers. We synthesized current knowledge on the connectivity established between countries by landbirds and raptors migrating along the African–Eurasian flyway. We reviewed tracking studies to compile migration records for 1229 individual birds, from which we derived 544 migratory links, each link corresponding to a species’ connection between a breeding country in Europe and a nonbreeding country in sub‐Saharan Africa. We used these migratory links to analyze trends in knowledge over time and spatial patterns of connectivity per country (across species), per species (across countries), and at the flyway scale (across all countries and all species). The number of tracking studies available increased steadily since 2010 (particularly for landbirds), but the coverage of existing tracking data was highly incomplete. An average of 7.5\% of migratory landbird species and 14.6\% of raptor species were tracked per country. More data existed from central and western European countries, and it was biased toward larger bodied species. We provide species‐ and country‐level syntheses of the migratory links we identified from the reviewed studies, involving 123 populations of 43 species, migrating between 28 European and 43 African countries. Several countries (e.g., Spain, Poland, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of Congo) are strategic priorities for future tracking studies to complement existing data, particularly on landbirds. Despite the limitations in existing tracking data, our data and results can inform discussions under 2 key policy instruments at the flyway scale: the African–Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan and the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia.

              Conectividad entre países establecida por aves terrestres y rapaces que migran a través del corredor aéreo africano‐euroasiático
              
                Resumen
                La conservación de las aves que migran grandes distancias requiere de una coordinación entre los varios países conectados por los movimientos de estas especies. La expansión reciente de los estudios de rastreo está descubriendo novedades en estos movimientos, aunque gran parte de esta información está fragmentada y es inaccesible para quienes practican y elaboran las políticas de conservación. Sintetizamos el conocimiento actual sobre la conectividad establecida entre países por las aves terrestres y rapaces que migran a través del corredor aéreo africano‐euroasiático. Revisamos los estudios de rastreo para compilar los registros migratorios de 1229 aves, de los cuales derivamos 544 conexiones migratorias, con cada conexión correspondiendo a la conexión que tiene una especie entre un país europeo en donde se reproduce con un país de la África subsahariana en donde no se reproduce. Usamos estas conexiones migratorias para analizar las tendencias informativas en patrones espaciales y temporales de conectividad por país (en todas las especies), por especie (en todos los países) y a escala del corredor aéreo (en todas las especies y en todos los países). El número de estudios de rastreo disponibles incrementó gradualmente a partir de 2010 (particularmente para las aves terrestres), pero la cobertura de los datos de rastreo existentes estaba incompleta. Se rastreó en promedio 7.5\% de especies de aves terrestres migratorias y 14.6\% de aves rapaces por país. Existían más datos de los países del centro y oeste de Europa, los cuales estaban sesgados hacia las especies de mayor tamaño. Proporcionamos varias síntesis a nivel de especie y país de las conexiones migratorias que identificamos a partir de la revisión de estudios, las cuales involucran a 123 poblaciones de 43 especies que migran entre 28 países europeos y 43 países africanos. Varios países, como España, Polonia, Etiopía y la República Democrática del Congo son prioridades estratégicas para complementar los datos existentes en los siguientes estudios de rastreo, en especial para las aves terrestres. A pesar de las limitaciones que tienen los datos de rastreo existentes, nuestros datos y resultados pueden orientar las discusiones con dos instrumentos claves para las políticas: el Plan de Acción de las Aves Terrestres Migratorias Africanas‐Euroasiáticas y el Memorando de Entendimiento sobre la Conservación de las Aves Rapaces Migratorias de África y Eurasia.

              《世界自然保护联盟 (IUCN) 红色名录》设定的标准是评估物种灭绝风险以及在适当的情况下宣布生物灭绝的黄金标准。然而, 与所有其它濒危等级不同的是, “灭绝”等级缺乏一个确定该等级的量化框架。鉴于划分这个等级存在主观性, 我们访问调查了研究多种类群的专家评估员, 以探究他们宣布物种灭绝时考虑的因素。本研究利用选择实验的方法, 调查了来自世界自然保护联盟物种生存委员会专家组和工作组的 674 名专家。我们发现, 在推断物种灭绝时, 数据可获得性、距离最后一次发现的时间、可监测性、栖息地可获得性和种群下降情况都是评估者关注的重要属性。曾参与红色名录工作的受访者在分析物种灭绝时, 更重视数据可获得性、距离最后一次发现的时间和可监测性, 而那些研究人们认识较多的类群的受访者则更重视距离最后一次发现的时间。没有参与过红色名录工作的受访者和研究人们认识较多的类群 (即哺乳动物和鸟类) 的受访者总体上更少考虑物种灭绝的问题。以上关于评估者对宣布物种灭绝影响因素的重视程度的结果, 可以为制定更准确地评估物种灭绝的具体标准提供依据。

	abstract = {Birds migrate over vast distances at substantial costs. The highly dynamic nature of the air makes the selection of the best travel route difﬁcult. We investigated to what extent migratory birds may optimise migratory route choice with respect to wind, and if route choice can be subject to natural selection. Following the optimal route, calculated using 21 years of empirical global wind data, reduced median travel time by 26.5\% compared to the spatially shortest route. When we used a time-dependent survival model to quantify the adaptive beneﬁt of choosing a ﬁxed wind-optimised route, 84.8\% of pairs of locations yielded a route with a higher survival than the shortest route. This suggests that birds, even if incapable of predicting wind individually, could adjust their migratory routes at a population level. As a consequence, this may result in the emergence of low-cost ﬂyways representing a global network of aerial migratory pathways.},

	abstract = {As people, animals and materials are transported across increasingly large distances in a globalized world, threats to our biosecurity and food security are rising. Aotearoa New Zealand is an island nation with many endemic species, a strong local agricultural industry, and a need to protect these from pest threats, as well as the economy from fraudulent commodities. Mitigation of such threats is much more effective if their origins and pathways for entry are understood. We propose that this may be addressed in Aotearoa using strontium isotope analysis of both pests and products. Bioavailable radiogenic isotopes of strontium are ubiquitous markers of provenance that are increasingly used to trace the origin of animals and plants as well as products, but currently a baseline map across Aotearoa is lacking, preventing use of this technique. Here, we have improved an existing methodology to develop a regional bioavailable strontium isoscape using the best available geospatial datasets for Aotearoa. The isoscape explains 53\% of the variation (R2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 0.00098) across the region, for which the primary drivers are the underlying geology, soil pH, and aerosol deposition (dust and sea salt). We tested the potential of this model to determine the origin of cow milk produced across Aotearoa. Predictions for cow milk (n = 33) highlighted all potential origin locations that share similar 87Sr/86Sr values, with the closest predictions averaging 7.05 km away from their true place of origin. These results demonstrate that this bioavailable strontium isoscape is effective for tracing locally produced agricultural products in Aotearoa. Accordingly, it could be used to certify the origin of Aotearoa’s products, while also helping to determine if new pest detections were of locally breeding populations or not, or to raise awareness of imported illegal agricultural products.},

	abstract = {The region of present-day Angola was one of the main areas from which millions of enslaved Africans were abducted and forced to migrate to the Americas during the transatlantic slave trade. Strontium isotope (87Sr/86Sr) analysis is a useful tool in reconstructing large-scale human movements across geologically distinct landscapes in archaeological and forensic contexts. However, the absence of environmental 87Sr/86Sr reference data from Angola hinders the use of 87Sr/86Sr analysis in provenance studies related to Angola, especially in identifying the geographic origin of enslaved people in the African Diaspora. Here, we measured 101 plant samples from most, yet not all, major geological units to draft the first bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr map (isoscape) for Angola using a machine learning framework. Our results suggest that the 87Sr/86Sr ratios in Angola span a large range from 0.70679 to 0.76815 between the different geological units. Specifically, the high average 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.74097 (±0.00938, 1 SD) found in the Angola Block of central Angola, are distinctly more radiogenic than any previously published bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for western Central and West Africa. However, these match the 87Sr/86Sr ratios previously published for human enamel samples from four historic slavery contexts in the Americas. We demonstrate that our strontium isoscape of Angola greatly improves the ability to assess the possible origins of enslaved African individuals discovered outside of Africa and encourage the future use of emerging African isoscapes in the study of life histories within the slave trade.},

Geographical variation in strontium isotopes is primarily controlled by the underlying geology but there are many other factors that need to be considered before migratory individuals can be identiﬁed. Consequently, despite many studies which have shown that the method works well, it is clear that much remains to be clariﬁed and it will not work for every question or in every place. It rests on the assumption that people were sourcing their food locally and that there is a measurable strontium isotope difference between the place the person migrated from and the place they migrated to. As migrants may deliberately seek out familiar soil types and terrains in their new homeland, some questions surrounding major migration events may prove intractable for this technique. Other factors that can create heterogeneity or homogeneity leading to false positives or false negatives, such as human choices or coastal subsistence, are explored and the metabolism of strontium into human tooth enamel is discussed. Several models of land-use choices by humans are presented to highlight the subtleties inherent in the isotope data and these are used to interpret archaeological human isotope ratios from three studies.},

Here, we use sediment geochemistry and 87Sr/86Sr and 143Nd/144Nd isotopes to examine historical dust deposition rates to alpine lakes in the southwestern region of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. We evaluate the biological response using diatom fossil assemblages and sediment pigment concentrations. Sediment core analyses indicated that prior to a recent rise in dust ﬂux, phosphorus concentrations and species composition were similar to those found in other alpine lakes in the region. Concomitant with a  50 fold increase in dust ﬂux to the sediments circa 1940, sediment proxies revealed a two- to threefold increase in normalized sediment phosphorus content, an increase in the diatom-inferred total dissolved phosphorus concentration from   4 to 9-12 lg L21, a tenfold increase in diatom production, and a relative increase in cyanobacteria abundance. The increase in dust inﬂux during the 20th century appears to be due in part to human factors and demonstrates the potential for dust and other atmospheric pollutants to signiﬁcantly alter remote aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest (RF) are being increasingly applied on traditionally geographical topics such as population estimation. Even though RF is a well performing and generalizable algorithm, the vast majority of its implementations is still ‘aspatial’ and may not address spatial heterogenous processes. At the same time, remote sensing (RS) data which are commonly used to model population can be highly spatially heterogeneous. From this scope, we present a novel geographical implementation of RF, named Geographical Random Forest (GRF) as both a predictive and exploratory tool to model population as a function of RS covariates. GRF is a disaggregation of RF into geographical space in the form of local sub-models. From the ﬁrst empirical results, we conclude that GRF can be more predictive when an appropriate spatial scale is selected to model the data, with reduced residual autocorrelation and lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. Finally, and of equal importance, GRF can be used as an effective exploratory tool to visualize the relationship between dependent and independent variables, highlighting interesting local variations and allowing for a better understanding of the processes that may be causing the observed spatial heterogeneity.},

Our approach is especially well-adapted for prediction interval estimation; we show via simulations that our proposed prediction intervals are competitive with, and in some settings outperform, existing methods. To establish theoretical grounding for our framework, we prove pointwise uniform consistency of a more stringent version of our estimator of the conditional prediction error distribution function.

Uncovering the level of migratory connectivity is crucial for effective conservation actions and for understanding of the evolution of local adaptations and migratory routes. Here we investigate migration patterns in a passerine bird, the great reed warbler
              Acrocephalus arundinaceus
              , over its wide Western Palearctic breeding range using geolocators from Spain, Sweden, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Turkey. We found moderate migratory connectivity: a highly significant spatial structure in the connections between breeding and sub‐Saharan non‐breeding grounds, but at the same time a partial overlap between individual populations, particularly along the Gulf of Guinea where the majority of birds from the Spanish, Swedish and Czech populations spent their non‐breeding period. The post‐breeding migration routes were similar in direction and rather parallel for the five populations. Birds from Turkey showed the most distinctive migratory routes and sub‐Saharan non‐breeding range, with a post‐breeding migration to east Africa and, together with birds from Bulgaria, a previously unknown pre‐breeding migration over the Arabian Peninsula indicating counter‐clockwise loop migration. The distances between breeding and sub‐Saharan non‐breeding sites, as well as between first and final sub‐Saharan non‐breeding sites, differed among populations. However, the total speed of migration did not differ significantly between populations; neither during post‐breeding migration in autumn, nor pre‐breeding migration in spring. There was also no significant relationship between the total speed of migration and distance between breeding and non‐breeding sites (neither post‐ nor pre‐breeding) and, surprisingly, the total speed of migration generally did not differ significantly between post‐breeding and pre‐breeding migration. Future challenges include understanding whether non‐breeding environmental conditions may have influenced the differences in migratory patterns that we observed between populations, and to which extent non‐breeding habitat fluctuations and loss may affect population sizes of migrants.},

              has been defended for the sake of tradition and gastronomy. Hunters argued that ortolan buntings trapped in southwest France originate from large and stable populations across the whole of Europe. Yet, the European Commission referred France to the Court of Justice of the European Union (EU) in December 2016 for infringements to legislation (IP/16/4213). To better assess the impact of hunting in France, we combined Pan-European data from archival light loggers, stable isotopes, and genetics to determine the migration strategy of the species across continents. Ortolan buntings migrating through France come from northern and western populations, which are small, fragmented and declining. Population viability modeling further revealed that harvesting in southwest France is far from sustainable and increases extinction risk. These results provide the sufficient scientific evidence for justifying the ban on ortolan harvesting in France.},

	abstract = {Migratory connectivity is the degree to which populations are linked in space and time across the annual cycle. Low connectivity indicates mixing of populations while high connectivity indicates population separation in space or time. High migratory connectivity makes individual populations susceptible to local environmental conditions; therefore, evaluating migratory connectivity continuously across a species range is important for understanding differential population trends and revealing places and times contributing to these differences. The common nighthawk
              Chordeiles minor
              is a widespread, declining, long‐distance migratory bird. Variable population trends across the nighthawk breeding range suggest that knowledge of migratory connectivity is needed to direct conservation. We used GPS tags to track 52 individuals from 12 breeding populations. We estimated migratory connectivity as 0.29 (Mantel coefficient: 0 = no connectivity, 1 = full connectivity) between the breeding and wintering grounds. We then estimated migratory connectivity at every latitude (spatial connectivity) or day (temporal connectivity) of migration and smoothed those migratory connectivity estimates to produce continuous migratory connectivity ‘profiles'. Spatial and temporal connectivity were highest during migration through North America (around 0.3–0.6), with values generally around 0 in Central and South America due to mixing of populations along a common migratory route and similar migration timing across populations. We found local peaks in spatial and temporal connectivity during migration associated with crossing the Gulf of Mexico. We used simulations to estimate the probability that our method missed peaks (spatial: 0.12, temporal: 0.18) or detected false peaks (spatial: 0.11, temporal: 0.37) due to data gaps and showed that our approach remains useful even for sparse and/or sporadic location data. Our study presents a generalizable approach to evaluating migratory connectivity across the full annual cycle that can be used to focus migratory bird conservation towards places and times of the annual cycle where populations are more likely to be limited.},

              Biophysical approaches validated against haplotype and trap catch patterns have modeled the migratory trajectory of fall armyworms at a semi-continental scale, from their natal origins in Texas or Florida through much of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. However, unexplained variation in the validation analysis was present, and misalignments between the simulated movement patterns of fall armyworm populations and the haplotype ratios at several locations, especially in the northeastern US and Canada, have been reported.
            
            
              Methods
              Using an expanded dataset extending into Canada, we assess the consistency of haplotype patterns that relate overwintered origins of fall armyworm populations to hypothesized dispersal trajectories in North America and compare the geographic distribution of these patterns with previous model projections.
            
            
              Results and discussion
              We confirm the general accuracy of previous modeling efforts, except for late in the season where our data suggests a higher proportion of Texas populations invading the northeast, extending into eastern Canada. We delineate geographic limits to the range of both overwintering populations and show that substantial intermixing of the Texas and Florida migrants routinely occurs north of South Carolina. We discuss annual variation to these migratory trajectories and test the hypothesis that the Appalachian Mountains influence geographic patterns of haplotypes. We discuss how these results may limit gene flow between the Texas and Florida natal populations and limit the hereditary consequences of interbreeding between these populations.},

In winter 2018–2019, the population plummeted even farther, to fewer than 30,000 monarchs, which represents a single year drop of 86\% and a drop of {\textgreater}99\% since the 1980s. The population may now be hovering at its quasi-extinction threshold. In this Perspectives piece, we: (1) Place the current status in context, (2) Highlight the most likely window during the annual life cycle when the population declined, (3) Review probable causes of long-term declines, and (4) Recommend steps that the public, policy makers, and land managers can take to recover western monarchs. The available studies reinforce the hypotheses that overwintering habitat loss and loss of central California breeding habitat, as well as pesticide use, are likely important contributors to the western monarch’s long-term decline. The most limiting part of the migratory cycle appears to be concentrated during the overwintering stage and/or in early spring. If western monarchs are in fact entering an extinction vortex, they need extraordinary efforts—focused on the most vulnerable periods of the annual cycle— to save the migration. Critical short-term conservation priorities are to (1) Protect, manage and restore overwintering habitat, (2) Protect monarchs and their habitat from pesticides, (3) Restore breeding and migratory habitat in California, (4) Protect, manage, and restore summer breeding and fall migration monarch habitat throughout the western monarch’s range, and (5) Fill research gaps to inform western monarch recovery strategies.},

	abstract = {Communicating new scientific discoveries is key to human progress. Yet, this endeavor has been increasingly hindered by monetary restrictions that restrain scientists from publishing their findings and accessing other scientists’ reports. This process is further exacerbated by a large portion of publishing media owned by private companies that, in contrast with journals from scientific societies, do not reinject academic publishing benefits into the scientific community. As the academic world is not exempt from economic crises and funding restrictions, new alternatives are necessary to support a fair and economically sustainable publishing system for scientists and society as a whole. After summarizing major shortcomings of academic publishing today, we present several solutions that span the levels of the individual scientist, the scientific community, and the publisher to initiate a transformative change towards more sustainable scientific publishing. By providing a voice to the many scientists who are fundamental protagonists, yet often powerless witnesses, of the academic publishing system, as well as a roadmap for implementing solutions, we hope this initiative will go beyond sparking increased awareness and promote a shift towards more sustainable scientific publishing practices.},

In the desert and subdesert regions the eremic element is prominent among the sedentary species though migration plays an important role. About two-thirds of the butterflies in the ecologically adverse parts of the peninsula are more or less dependent on migration. The Oriental element is negligible. There are three distinct centres of Palaearctic relicts of unequal age and different geographic derivation. The ecological provinces of Asir, Yemen, Aden, the Hadhramaut, Dhofar and probably northern Oman should be considered as pertaining to the Afrotropical Region. The remainder of the peninsula should be allocated to the Eremic Zone, the identity and importance of which has become increasingly clear in recent years. Levels of endemicity at species and subspecies level are lower among the Rhopalocera than among most other arthropod groups, and only in southwestern Arabia does it reach significant proportions. Despite the general Afrotropical nature of the butterfly fauna the significance of the peninsula as a zoogeographical crossroads between the Afrotropical, Palaearctic and Oriental Regions is apparent. Comparisons of butterfly zoogeography with that of other groups of arthropods would be most useful but the necessary comparative data are still largely missing.},

            Recent studies suggest that the energetic demands of long-distance migration might lower the pool of resources available for costly immune defenses. Moreover, migration could amplify the costs of parasitism if animals suffering from parasite-induced damage or depleted energy reserves are less able to migrate long distances. We investigated relationships between long-distance migration, infection, and immunity in wild fall-migrating monarch butterflies Danaus plexippus. Monarchs migrate annually from eastern North America to central Mexico, accumulating lipids essential for migration and winter survival as they travel southward. Monarchs are commonly infected by the debilitating protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE). We collected data on lipid reserves, parasite loads, and two immune measures (hemocyte concentration and phenoloxidase activity) from wild monarchs migrating through north GA (USA) to ask whether (1) parasite infection negatively affects lipid reserves, and (2) greater investment in lipid reserves is associated with lower immune measures. Results showed that monarchs sampled later in the fall migration had lower but not significantly different immune measures and significantly higher lipid reserves than those sampled earlier. Lipid measures correlated negatively but only nearly significantly with one measure of immune defense (phenoloxidase activity) in both healthy and infected monarchs, but did not depend on monarch infection status or parasite load. These results provide weak support for a trade-off between energy reserves and immune defense in migrants, and suggest that previously-demonstrated costs of OE infection for monarch migration are not caused by depleted lipid reserves.},

	abstract = {There is compelling evidence that Afro-Palaearctic (A-P) migrant bird populations have declined in Europe in recent decades, often to a greater degree than resident or shortdistance migrants. There appear to have been two phases of decline. The ﬁrst in the 1960s–1970s, and in some cases into the early 1980s, largely affected species wintering predominantly in the arid Sahelian zone, and the second since the 1980s has mostly affected species wintering in the humid tropics and Guinea forest zone. Potential drivers of these declines are diverse and are spread across and interact within the migratory cycle. Our knowledge of declining species is generally better for the breeding than the non-breeding parts of their life cycles, but there are signiﬁcant gaps in both for many species. On the breeding grounds, degradation of breeding habitats is the factor affecting the demography of the largest number of species, particularly within agricultural systems and woodland and forests. In the non-breeding areas, the interacting factors of anthropogenic habitat degradation and climatic conditions, particularly drought in the Sahel zone, appear to be the most important factors. Based on our synthesis of existing information, we suggest four priorities for further research: (1) use of new and emerging tracking technologies to identify migratory pathways and strategies, understand migratory connectivity and enable ﬁeld research to be targeted more effectively; (2) undertake detailed ﬁeld studies in sub-Saharan Africa and at staging sites, where we understand little about distribution patterns, habitat use and foraging ecology; (3) make better use of the wealth of data from the European breeding grounds to explore spatial and temporal patterns in demographic parameters and relate these to migratory pathways and large-scale patterns of habitat change and climatic factors; and (4) make better use of remote sensing to improve our understanding of how and where land cover is changing across these extensive areas and how this impacts A-P migrants. This research needs to inform and underpin a ﬂyway approach to conservation, evaluating a suite of drivers across the migratory cycle and combining this with an understanding of land management practices that integrate the needs of birds and people in these areas.},

	abstract = {1. From the study of the historical records of European invasions by
              Locusta
              from the 14th century to the present day, it is concluded that the subspecies concerned was
              L. m. migratoria
              originating in the West Pontian outbreak area. This area formerly comprised the lower courses of rivers draining into the Black Sea from the Danube to the Dniepr inclusive, and is now confined to the delta of the Danube. From here swarms migrated into central Europe and the eastern part of the north European plain. The northern part of the plain, the British Isles and Fenno-Scandia, lie on the outskirts of the invasion area, and as a rule were only reached by small detachments from swarms. The decline of the West Pontian outbreak centres was accompanied by the gradual decline of the area subject to invasions by large swarms, but during outbreaks small groups and separate individuals of ph.
              gregaria
              continue to reach the further limits of the invasion area.
            
            
              2. The distances covered within a single generation by swarms of
              L. m. migratoria
              in temperate Europe (up to 1,600 miles) were comparable in extent to those traversed by
              L. m. migratorioides
              in tropical Africa.
            
            
              3. Long-range migrations to the extreme limits of the invasion area are not confined to
              L. m. migratoria
              ph.
              gregaria
              but occur also in ph.
              solitaria
              . This is shown by the arrival of individuals of this phase in the British Isles during theperiod when the West Pontian outbreak areas are in a quiescent state. From this and from literature data on other locust species it is concluded that long-range migration is a regular seasonal phenomenon in swarming a
              crididae
              , independent of the presence of large numbers or the phase.
            
            
              4. The late summer immigration of
              L. m. migratoria
              into the British Isles may be a part of a more general east to west movement of flying insects which may occur in Europe at that season.
            
            
              5. It is probable that
              L. m. migratoria
              sometimes oviposit in the British Isles, for they may arrive in a mature state, or during exceptionally hot summers in southeastern England they may reach sexual maturity after arrival. The eggs, however, are apparently unable to survive winter conditions.},

Locust biology is often linked to abiotic conditions like temperature and/or precipitation, fueling the perception that aside from active control, humans are not key players in the interaction locusts have with their environment. However, several studies have shown that land management practices like grazing heavily inﬂuences locust-human linkages. In this review we synthesize published research and reports on connections between locust outbreaks and ranching. For this, we conducted an extensive literature search using Google Scholar on the 19 species of grasshoppers that are currently considered to be locusts or non-model locusts. Species were sorted according to their feeding guilds: (1) forb- and/or tree-feeding locusts; (2) mix-feeding locusts (grasses, forbs, and/or trees); (3) grass-feeding locusts. We review their pest status, ecology, and relationship with grazing. We then discuss the overall data and draw general patterns on how locusts and locust control affect livestock grazing through various mechanisms (competition, nutritional preferences, pesticide use, nutrient cycling). We draw attention to “telecoupling” a process in which land management practices like grazing have ecological feedbacks on locust populations, which in turn affects food security in distant regions due to the migratory capacity of locusts. Finally, we present new perspectives for sustainable management practices that integrate understanding of land management.},

	abstract = {The desert locust is an agricultural pest that is able to switch from a harmless solitarious stage, during recession periods, to swarms of gregarious individuals that disperse long distances and affect areas from western Africa to India during outbreak periods. Large outbreaks have been recorded through centuries, and the Food and Agriculture Organization keeps a long-term, large-scale monitoring survey database in the area. However, there is also a much less known subspecies that occupies a limited area in Southern Africa. We used large-scale climatic and occurrence data of the solitarious phase of each subspecies during recession periods to understand whether both subspecies climatic niches differ from each other, what is the current potential geographical distribution of each subspecies, and how climate change is likely to shift their potential distribution with respect to current conditions. We evaluated whether subspecies are significantly specialized along available climate gradients by using null models of background climatic differences within and between southern and northern ranges and applying niche similarity and niche equivalency tests. The results point to climatic niche conservatism between the two clades. We complemented this analysis with species distribution modeling to characterize current solitarious distributions and forecast potential recession range shifts under two extreme climate change scenarios at the 2050 and 2090 time horizon. Projections suggest that, at a global scale, the northern clade could contract its solitarious recession range, while the southern clade is likely to expand its recession range. However, local expansions were also predicted in the northern clade, in particular in southern and northern margins of the current geographical distribution. In conclusion, monitoring and management practices should remain in place in northern Africa, while in Southern Africa the potential for the subspecies to pose a threat in the future should be investigated more closely.},

Consequently, desert locust populations increased rapidly and swarms invaded eleven countries in West Africa, severely disrupting agricultural production in areas already sensitive to food security.

EURING ring-recovery data were used to estimate directions and proportional usage of flyways. The timing of migration was compared along these routes and breeding origins of shot individuals were determined. Ring recoveries of Czech, Hungarian, British, German and French birds suggested three main flyways with westerly, central and easterly directions. The proportional usage was estimated by multinomial mark-recovery models. Major parts of French (62\%), German (92\%) and British (94\%) Turtle Doves followed a western flyway. Czech birds used the central route (56\%) and 55\% of Hungarian birds followed the eastern flyway. Thus, a migratory divide between the Czech Republic and Germany could be suggested. The timing of migration showed a similar latitudinal pattern of migration along all flyways. Birds were at the breeding grounds in June and July and from September to April in their southernmost distribution ranges. Outward migration started in August. Return migration was still evident in May. The majority of reported hunted doves were from the 1960s and 1970s. High hunting numbers were present in September, April and May. France and Spain mainly shot birds from the UK and France. In Italy predominantly Italian birds were shot. Doves shot in Greece mostly came from the Czech Republic. Given the decreasing population numbers, large ringing numbers seem unlikely in the future. Thus, low recovery numbers in recent decades parallel both, the population decrease and a lower ringing activity.},

Most existing BMSs are in temperate climates; however, the Israeli Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS-IL), established in 2009, is a notable exception as it encompasses a large climatic gradient from Euro-Siberian through Mediterranean to hyper-arid regions. Israel’s climate poses challenges in analyzing data from year-round butterfly activity, as in other tropical or arid countries. The Regional Generalized Additive Model (Regional GAM) is a butterfly phenology and abundance model based on repeat visits throughout species’ flight season. We tested the applicability of Regional GAM for species with complex flight seasonality (e.g., multivoltine) by comparing estimated abundance and seasonal indices for the full data set and rarefied subsets. We assessed the reliability of modeled flight seasons and compared abundance estimates per site resulting from biologically plausible and unreliable seasonal models. The reliability of Regional GAM rises with the number of observations, and the model tends to produce more biologically plausible models for species with simple phenologies (e.g., univoltine with a single peak in activity). Abundance estimates based on unreliable models produce values with interquartile ranges of 90\%–153\% compared with biologically plausible models, while peak time changes with an interquartile range of 0–22.5 d when comparing all rarefied models with the full data set. Regional GAM should be applied with great caution for rare species and those with a complex flight season, and the date of year start needs to be carefully chosen for species that are active year-round. We identified the key sources of error and propose an operational workflow to address them. With few adaptations, Regional GAM can support new BMSs in analyzing data where butterflies are active year-round, including tropical climates. We propose guidelines for analyzing BMS data for species or regions with long activity periods and complex phenologies.},

1.It is widely accepted that the arrival order of migratory birds is correlated with the condition of the birds, which leads to high quality individuals occupying prime sites. However, the theoretical backgrounds for this argument have been lacking. A simple game-theoretic model of arrival timing is provided which investigates the evolutionary stability of condition-dependent arrival order in territorial migrant birds.



2.Competition for territories or other priority-dependent benefits can lead to arrival dates far preceding the cost-minimizing date (the optimum date in the absence of competition) for all but the weakest individuals. Increasing the number of competitors can generate a ‘cascading’ competition for early arrival, which advances arrival dates further apart from the individual optimum dates for the onset of breeding.



3.At equilibrium, arrival order corresponds strictly to condition order only if marginal costs of advancing arrival are always larger for individuals in lower condition. If spring mortality vacates territories for later-arriving birds, the criterion for ‘honest’ arrival order becomes still stricter: differential survival costs should exist, but survival differences among individuals (or, alternatively, territory quality differences) should not be very large.



4.If the habitat is saturated so that there is a risk of not obtaining a territory at all, or if worst territories are of much lower value than the rest, competition may lead to the majority of the population arriving within a fairly short interval, followed by a much later floating fraction. This synchrony in the arrival of breeders imposes an increasing cost for the lesser fit breeding birds. Thus, arrival costs paid are not necessarily highest for earliest arriving individuals, but for those who have the most to lose if they drop a few steps in the arrival order.



5.Competition for high quality territories can also lead to partial migration, in which case birds in good condition are expected to be most likely to remain resident.},

	abstract = {In migratory birds, early arrival on breeding sites is typically associated with greater breeding success, but the mechanisms driving these benefits are rarely known. One mechanism through which greater breeding success among early arrivers can potentially be achieved is the increased time available for replacement clutches following nest loss. However, the contribution of replacement clutches to breeding success will depend on seasonal variation in nest survival rates, and the consequences for juvenile recruitment of hatching at different times in the season. In particular, lower recruitment rates of late‐hatched chicks could offset the benefits to early arrivers of being able to lay replacement clutches, which would reduce the likelihood of replacement clutch opportunities influencing selection on migratory timings. Using a simulation model of time‐constrained capacity for replacement clutches, paramaterized with empirically‐derived estimates from avian migratory systems, we show that greater reproductive success among early‐arriving individuals can arise solely through the greater time capacity for replacement clutches among early arrivers, even when later renesting attempts contribute fewer recruits to the population. However, these relationships vary depending on the seasonal pattern of nest survival. The benefits of early arrival are greatest when nest survival rates are constant or decline seasonally, and early arrival is least beneficial when nest success rates increase over the breeding season, although replacement clutches can mitigate this effect. The time benefits of early arrival facilitating replacement clutches following nest loss may therefore be an important but overlooked source of selection on migratory timings. Empirical measures of seasonal variation in nest survival, renesting, and juvenile recruitment rates are therefore needed in order to identify the costs and benefits associated with individual migration phenology, the selection pressures influencing migratory timings, and the implications for ongoing shifts in migration and breeding phenology.},

	abstract = {We analysed body mass and moult data of six passerine species along their autumn migration route from northern Europe to North Africa and derived hypothetical models of the organisation of their migration in terms of fuel store accumulation. We analysed data of 46,541 first-year birds from 34 trapping sites, sampled in a network of collaborating European and African ringing stations. After accounting for effects of time of day and size, there were marked differences between the six species examined in the change of body mass along the migration route and in the timing of moult. Garden Warblers (Sylvia borin) and Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) underwent their postjuvenile moult prior to migration and increased their average body mass along the migration route. Sedge Warblers (Acrocephalus schoenobaenus) also increased body mass towards the south, but started the migration bout without further refuelling well before the Sahara and moulted mainly in the wintering grounds, Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scircpaceus) and Whitethroats (Sylvia communis) migrated while still moulting and did not increase average body mass towards south. They accumulated the energy needed to fly over the Sahara just before it. Spotted Flycatchers (Muscicapa striata) behaved in the same way, but contrary to Reed Warblers and Whitethroats they did not accumulate much fat stores in North Africa, which might urge them to stop and fuel up regularly in the Sahara. In the course of the season average body mass of all species increased slightly, which enabled them to migrate faster. In general, average body mass of first-year birds in northern and central Europe during the migration period was comparable to that of adults during breeding.},

However, this approach is outdated in a globalized world with rapid transportation means, where humans easily move long distances across borders. Cross-border cooperation in solving cold-cases is rare due to political, administrative or technical challenges. It is fundamental to develop new tools to provide rapid and cost-effective leads for international cooperation. In this work, we demonstrate that isotopic measurements are effective screening tools to help identify cold-cases with potential international ramifications. We first complete existing databases of hydrogen and sulfur isotopes in human hair from residents across North America by compiling or analyzing hair from Canada, the United States (US) and Mexico. Using these databases, we develop maps predicting isotope variations in human hair across North America. We demonstrate that both

These findings were validated by the subsequent identification of these individuals through the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner in Tucson, Arizona. In the second case study, we demonstrate that sequential multi-isotope analysis along the hair strands of an unidentified individual found in Canada provides detailed insights into the international mobility of this individual during the last year of life. In both cases, isotope data provide strong leads towards international travel.},

	abstract = {Potential natural vegetation (PNV) is the vegetation cover in equilibrium with climate, that would exist at a given location if not impacted by human activities. PNV is useful for raising public awareness about land degradation and for estimating land potential. This paper presents results of assessing machine learning algorithms—neural networks (nnet package), random forest (ranger), gradient boosting (gbm), K-nearest neighborhood (class) and Cubist—for operational mapping of PNV. Three case studies were considered: (1) global distribution of biomes based on the BIOME 6000 data set (8,057 modern pollen-based site reconstructions), (2) distribution of forest tree taxa in Europe based on detailed occurrence records (1,546,435 ground observations), and (3) global monthly fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) values (30,301 randomly-sampled points). A stack of 160 global maps representing biophysical conditions over land, including atmospheric, climatic, relief, and lithologic variables, were used as explanatory variables. The overall results indicate that random forest gives the overall best performance. The highest accuracy for predicting BIOME 6000 classes (20) was estimated to be between 33\% (with spatial cross-validation) and 68\% (simple random sub-setting), with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly temperatures, and bioclimatic layers. Predicting forest tree species (73) resulted in mapping accuracy of 25\%, with the most important predictors being monthly cloud fraction, mean annual and monthly temperatures, and elevation. Regression models for FAPAR (monthly images) gave an R-square of 90\% with the most important predictors being total annual precipitation, monthly cloud fraction, CHELSA bioclimatic layers, and month of the year, respectively. Further developments of PNV mapping could include using all GBIF records to map the global distribution of plant species at different taxonomic levels. This methodology could also be extended to dynamic modeling of PNV, so that future climate scenarios can be incorporated.

	abstract = {Allopatric speciation is thought to occur in the absence of gene ﬂow, thereby suggesting that widespread vagile species might be less likely to generate restricted sister taxa because of a lack of isolation. The butterﬂy genus Vanessa provides an ideal test of this concept, as it contains some of the most cosmopolitan and vagile species of butterﬂies on the planet, as well as some highly restricted taxa. Given the age of these groups, this arrangement offers a special opportunity to examine the relationship between vagility and phylogeny in generating novel taxa; speciﬁcally, does the vagility of some lineages impede allopatric speciation, leaving restricted clades more speciose? A phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed for all species belonging to the butterﬂy genus Vanessa based on DNA sequences from one mitochondrial and eight nuclear gene regions. The resulting topology shows very little conﬂict among gene regions, with ﬁve well-supported clades corresponding to morphologically consistent species groups. The data very strongly indicate a polyphyletic genus Antanartia, and thus to preserve monophyly two species previously assigned to Antanartia are transferred to Vanessa, Vanessa hippomene comb.n. and Vanessa dimorphica comb.n., resulting in a total of 22 species placed in Vanessa. A biogeographical analysis shows that in many cases the most geographically restricted species are sister to geographically widespread species, suggesting dispersal and allopatric speciation. Surprisingly, in almost all cases the divergences between widespread and restricted species are quite old ({\textgreater}5 Ma), suggesting long-term isolation and stability of both vagile and sedentary species, despite the high (even intercontinental) vagility of many extant species and, by extension, ancestral species. The biogeography of Vanessa suggests that species vagility and allopatry do not fully explain the forces governing cladogenesis in this remarkable genus.},

	abstract = {Monitoring pollinators is crucial for the evaluation of biodiversity and potential pollination services. Yet, effi­ ciently monitoring multiple taxa over large areas can be costly. An alternative approach is using simple species bioindicators that represent the entire pollinator community. One of the requirements of a good bioindicator is that it can be easily identified to lower taxonomic levels and be sensitive to changes in habitat. This is the case for butterflies, a taxon for which many countries have a country-wide long-term monitoring scheme. We tested whether butterfly diversity can be used to predict diversity of bees and hoverflies both spatially and temporally. We surveyed 42 transects of the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme in 2020, to record species richness and abundance of butterflies, bees and hoverflies. We also recorded flower area and richness in the pollinator transects. To test whether pollinators with similar functional traits are more closely correlated than the entire pollinator community, we categorized bee and butterfly species according to their diet breadth (polyphagous vs. non-polyphagous), nitrogen-affinity (nitrophobous vs. nitrophilous larval resources) and body size. We used the same methods to test for temporal correlations over seven years for one site in Spain. Butterfly richness was not spatially correlated with bee richness (Pearson’s r = 0.13), nor were the two taxa temporally correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.02). Interestingly, hoverfly richness was spatially correlated with butterfly richness (Pearson’s r = 0.43) and with bee richness (Pearson’s r = 0.36) in the Netherlands and, hence, hoverflies might be slightly more suitable as a bioindicator of pollinator diversity in this area. Abundance of all three taxa showed no sig­ nificant inter-correlation, except for correlations between diet specialist bees and butterflies (Pearson’s r = 0.39). Importantly, all three taxa were strongly correlated with flower richness, but they varied in their preferences for host plant families. This is in line with 75\% of the plant-pollinator studies finding significant positive relations. For monitoring schemes to be effective in informing better pollinator conservation, they should expand to include bees and hoverflies as well as simple indicators of habitat quality such as floral resources.},

	abstract = {Changes in the abundances of animals, such as with the ongoing concern about insect declines, are often assumed to be general across taxa. However, this assumption is largely untested. Here, we used a database of assemblage-wide long-term insect and arachnid monitoring to compare abundance trends among co-occurring pairs of taxa. We show that 60\% of co-occurring taxa qualitatively showed long-term trends in the same direction—either both increasing or both decreasing. However, in terms of magnitude, temporal trends were only weakly correlated (mean freshwater
              r
              = 0.05 (±0.03), mean terrestrial
              r
              = 0.12 (±0.09)). The strongest correlation was between trends of beetles and those of moths/butterflies (
              r
              = 0.26). Overall, even though there is some support for directional similarity in temporal trends, we find that changes in the abundance of one taxon provide little information on the changes of other taxa. No clear candidate for umbrella or indicator taxa emerged from our analysis. We conclude that obtaining a better picture of changes in insect abundances will require monitoring of multiple taxa, which remains uncommon, especially in the terrestrial realm.},

	abstract = {Monitoring pollinators is crucial for the evaluation of biodiversity and potential pollination services. Yet, effi­ ciently monitoring multiple taxa over large areas can be costly. An alternative approach is using simple species bioindicators that represent the entire pollinator community. One of the requirements of a good bioindicator is that it can be easily identified to lower taxonomic levels and be sensitive to changes in habitat. This is the case for butterflies, a taxon for which many countries have a country-wide long-term monitoring scheme. We tested whether butterfly diversity can be used to predict diversity of bees and hoverflies both spatially and temporally. We surveyed 42 transects of the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme in 2020, to record species richness and abundance of butterflies, bees and hoverflies. We also recorded flower area and richness in the pollinator transects. To test whether pollinators with similar functional traits are more closely correlated than the entire pollinator community, we categorized bee and butterfly species according to their diet breadth (polyphagous vs. non-polyphagous), nitrogen-affinity (nitrophobous vs. nitrophilous larval resources) and body size. We used the same methods to test for temporal correlations over seven years for one site in Spain. Butterfly richness was not spatially correlated with bee richness (Pearson’s r = 0.13), nor were the two taxa temporally correlated (Pearson’s r = 0.02). Interestingly, hoverfly richness was spatially correlated with butterfly richness (Pearson’s r = 0.43) and with bee richness (Pearson’s r = 0.36) in the Netherlands and, hence, hoverflies might be slightly more suitable as a bioindicator of pollinator diversity in this area. Abundance of all three taxa showed no sig­ nificant inter-correlation, except for correlations between diet specialist bees and butterflies (Pearson’s r = 0.39). Importantly, all three taxa were strongly correlated with flower richness, but they varied in their preferences for host plant families. This is in line with 75\% of the plant-pollinator studies finding significant positive relations. For monitoring schemes to be effective in informing better pollinator conservation, they should expand to include bees and hoverflies as well as simple indicators of habitat quality such as floral resources.},

	abstract = {Migration and overwintering of Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) in south-eastern Australia is reviewed. Overwintering, non-reproductive aggregations of Monarchs were first reported in the 1930s and 1940s from near Sydney, New South Wales and Adelaide, South Australia but scientific studies on overwintering and migration did not occur until the 1960s–1980s. During the early 1960s, overwintering populations ranged from 15,000–40,000 individuals at sites SW of Sydney. In the late 1970s overwintering populations in the Sydney area comprised only 400–3,500 individuals, a decline of {\textgreater} 90\%. By 1984, 21 sites harboring autumn or winter populations had been reported from the Sydney area, the Hunter Valley ({\textasciitilde} 100 km NNW of Sydney) and the Mt Lofty Ranges near Adelaide. Overwintering sites in New South Wales appear to be populated by autumn migrants originating from higher elevation areas to the SW and W of Sydney, the Hunter Valley and lower mid-north coast. Migration and reproductive dormancy in late summer and autumn Monarchs are induced by cool ({\textless} 18 ˚C), overcast conditions post-eclosion. All overwintering sites are characterized by the presence of Milkweed (Gomphocarpus fruticosus L. (R. Br.)). Additional overwintering sites are reported from New South Wales (8), South Australia (1), and for the first time in Victoria (2) and on Flinders Island (Tasmania) (1), providing a total of 33 sites in SE Australia currently or historically known to harbor clustering or overwintering populations of Monarch butterflies. Populations reported at the new sites ranged from {\textless}100 – {\textgreater}2,000, suggesting no further radical decline in Monarch numbers since the late 1970s. Observations on the phenology, size and behavior of transient (2013) and overwintering (2017) populations of Monarchs at a new site 275 km N of Sydney, New South Wales, are reported. Overnight clustering of Monarchs on Milkweed host plants (G. fruticosus) at this site is documented. The annual status, size and phenology of Monarch populations at overwintering sites in south-eastern Australia is unknown and must be a priority for future research and monitoring. The non-native status of the Monarch and the Milkweeds it uses, has in the past not favored concern and conservation of this iconic species in Australia.},

Monarchs also occur in the North American states west of the Rocky Mountains, from where they fly shorter distances to the California Coast. Whether eastern and western North American monarchs form one genetic population or are genetically differentiated remains hotly debated, and resolution of this debate is essential to understand monarch migration patterns and to protect this iconic insect species. We studied the genetic structure of North American migratory monarch populations, as well as nonmigratory populations in Hawaii and New Zealand. Our results show that eastern and western migratory monarchs form one admixed population and that monarchs from Hawaii and New Zealand have genetically diverged from North American butterflies. These findings suggest that eastern and western monarch butterflies maintain their divergent migrations despite genetic mixing. The finding that eastern and western monarchs form one genetic population also suggests that the conservation of overwintering sites in Mexico is crucial for the protection of monarchs in both eastern and western North America.},

	abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) undergo an iconic multi-­generational migration, traveling thousands of kilometers from the summer breeding grounds in southern Canada to overwintering sites in central Mexico. This migration phenomena can be affected by climate change, which may have important implications on fitness and ultimately populations status. We investigated the long-­term trends in fall migration phenology of monarchs using a 25-­year dataset collected along the coast of Lake Erie in Ontario, Canada. We also investigated local long-­term trends in weather covariates that have the potential to influence migration phenology at this site. Patterns in standardized daily counts of monarchs were compared with local weather covariates using two methods (i.e., monthly averages and moving windows) to assess difference in outputs between analytical approaches. Our results suggest that monarch migration timing (migration midpoint, average peak, first peak, and late passage) and weather covariates have been consistent over time, in direct contrast to a similar study in Cape May, New Jersey, which showed a significant increase in both fall temperature and a 16-­to 19-­day shift in monarch migration timing. Furthermore, our results differed between analytical approaches. With respect to annual variability in air temperature, our monthly average analysis suggested that for each degree increase in September air temperature, late season passage would advance 4.71 days (±1.59 SE, p = .01). However, the moving window analysis suggested that this result is likely spurious and found no significant correlations between migration timing and any weather covariates. Importantly, our results caution against extrapolating the effects of climate change on the migration phenology of the monarch across study regions and the need for more long-­term monitoring efforts to better understand regional drivers of variability in migration timing.},

                  Assessing invertebrate species for the IUCN Red List under Criterion A frequently involves fitting an appropriate statistical model to available abundance data and calculating a 10‐year change (TYC) estimate from predicted abundances. When the rate of change has not been constant across the entire time series, models that accommodate variable change rates are recommended.
                
                
                  
                    The monarch butterfly (
                    Danaus plexippus
                    ) was recently added to the IUCN Red List (A2ab Endangered) based on analysis of data on winter abundances in Mexico and the western USA between 1993 and 2020. TYC estimates in the monarch assessment came from models that assumed constant change rates. We conducted a Bayesian analysis of the same data using models that accommodated variable change rates and used those models to compute TYC estimates.
                  
                
                
                  Our results suggested that monarch population change rates have not been constant over the study period. The analysis yielded a model‐averaged TYC estimate of +5.23\%, which was not statistically distinguishable from 0\% and was considerably different from values of −46\% and −72\% in the assessment. The Bayesian posterior probability of a TYC value below −30\% (A2ab Vulnerable) was 0.15 and that of a TYC value below −50\% (A2ab Endangered) was 0.03.
                
                
                  We recommend that researchers evaluating monarch conservation status consider using abundance models with variable change rates, as models with constant change rates may not accurately predict the trajectory of monarch abundances into the future.},

	abstract = {While negative perceptions of insects and other terrestrial arthropods (hereafter referred to collectively as ‘insects’) are widespread around the world, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. Negative attitudes towards insects manifest as the emotion disgust, which is regarded as a psychological adaptation to produce pathogen-avoidance behavior. Based on theories of evolutionary psychology (parasite avoidance theory of disgust and error management theory), we hypothesized that there are two pathways by which urbanization increases the intensity and breadth of feelings of disgust towards insects: (1) urbanization increases the extent to which people see insects indoors, and insects that are seen more often indoors induce stronger feelings of disgust than is induced by insects seen outdoors; and (2) urbanization reduces people's natural history knowledge about insects, and decreased knowledge results in a broader range of insects eliciting feelings of disgust. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online questionnaire survey and questionnaire experiment (n = 13,000) across Japan to quantify the association between the level of urbanization, places of insect sightings (outdoor/ indoor), knowledge about insects, and respondents' feelings of disgust. Our results supported both hypothetical pathway and suggested that psychological mechanisms shaped by past evolutionary pressure to avoid pathogen infection may underlie the current prevalence of insect disgust, and this is being reinforced by urbanization. Because negative perceptions of nature can reduce motivation for its conservation, negative attitudes towards insects exacerbated by ongoing urbanization is a potential global risk for biodiversity.},

Here we identify how the methodologies available for studying butterﬂy migration have changed over time, and document geographic and taxonomic foci in the study of butterﬂy migration. We review publications on butterﬂy migration published in six languages (English, Simpliﬁed Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish), summarise how migration in butterﬂies has been studied, explore geographic and taxonomic patterns in the knowledge base, and outline key future research directions. Using English search keywords, we found only 58 studies from Asia; however, after searching in local languages, we found an additional 98 relevant studies. Overall, butterﬂy migration studies are mostly from North America and Europe. Most studies focus on three species: monarch (Danaus plexippus), painted lady (Vanessa cardui) and red admiral (Vanessa atalanta). About 62\% of publications are focused on the monarch, with nearly 50\% of migratory butterﬂy species mentioned in only a single paper. Several research methods have been applied to ascribe migratory status and to study the physiology, neurobiology, and ecology of migration; however, virtually all this research is on a handful of species. There remain hundreds of species for which we do not understand the comprehensive seasonal pattern of movement, ﬂight destinations, wintering, or breeding grounds. A better understanding of movement ecology and migratory connectivity is needed to effectively conserve migratory butterﬂies. It is essential that research becomes more geographically and linguistically representative since migrants frequently cross political borders and international cooperation is necessary for their conservation.},

	abstract = {Bioassay incubation experiments conducted with nutrients and local atmospheric aerosol amendments indicate that phosphorus (P) availability limited phytoplankton growth in the low-nutrient low-chlorophyll (LNLC) ocean off Barbados. Atmospheric deposition provides a relatively large inﬂux of new nutrients and trace metals to the surface ocean in this region in comparison to other nutrient sources. However, the impact on native phytoplankton is muted due to the high ratio of nitrogen (N) to P (NO3:SRP {\textgreater} 40) and the low P solubility of these aerosols. Atmospheric deposition induces P limitation in this LNLC region by adding more N and iron (Fe) relative to P. This favors the growth of Prochlorococcus, a genus characterized by low P requirements and highly efﬁcient P acquisition mechanisms. A global three-dimensional marine ecosystem model that includes species-speciﬁc phytoplankton elemental quotas/stoichiometry and the atmospheric deposition of N, P, and Fe supports this conclusion. Future increases in aerosol N loading may therefore inﬂuence phytoplankton community structure in other LNLC areas, thereby affecting the biological pump and associated carbon sequestration.},

            CRU TS (Climatic Research Unit gridded Time Series) is a widely used climate dataset on a 0.5° latitude by 0.5° longitude grid over all land domains of the world except Antarctica. It is derived by the interpolation of monthly climate anomalies from extensive networks of weather station observations. Here we describe the construction of a major new version, CRU TS v4. It is updated to span 1901–2018 by the inclusion of additional station observations, and it will be updated annually. The interpolation process has been changed to use angular-distance weighting (ADW), and the production of secondary variables has been revised to better suit this approach. This implementation of ADW provides improved traceability between each gridded value and the input observations, and allows more informative diagnostics that dataset users can utilise to assess how dataset quality might vary geographically.},

We examined this possibility through changepoint analyses, assessing whether a change in trajectory existed over a 25-year times series. We found evidence of a change in trajectory in 2014, but insufﬁcient statistical support for a signiﬁcantly increasing population since that time (β = 0.285, 95\% CI = −0.127, 0.697). If the population estimate for winter 2019 is ≥4.0 ha, we will then be able to credibly assert the population has been increasing since 2014. However, given estimated levels of time series variability, presumed habitat capacity and no recent change in status or trend, there was a 13.5\% probability of observing a population estimate as large or larger than was reported for winter 2018. Our analyses highlight the incredible difﬁculty in drawing robust conclusions from annual changes in abundance over a short time series, especially for an insect that commonly exhibits considerable year-to-year variation. Thus, we urge caution when drawing conclusions regarding species status and trends for any species for which limited data are available.},

            Although research on human-mediated exchanges of species has substantially intensified during the last centuries, we know surprisingly little about temporal dynamics of alien species accumulations across regions and taxa. Using a novel database of 45,813 first records of 16,926 established alien species, we show that the annual rate of first records worldwide has increased during the last 200 years, with 37\% of all first records reported most recently (1970–2014). Inter-continental and inter-taxonomic variation can be largely attributed to the diaspora of European settlers in the nineteenth century and to the acceleration in trade in the twentieth century. For all taxonomic groups, the increase in numbers of alien species does not show any sign of saturation and most taxa even show increases in the rate of first records over time. This highlights that past efforts to mitigate invasions have not been effective enough to keep up with increasing globalization.},

	abstract = {Sulfur isotope composition of organic tissues is a commonly used tool for gathering information about provenance and diet in archaeology and paleoecology. However, the lack of maps predicting sulfur isotope variations on the landscape limits the possibility to use this isotopic system in quantitative geographic assignments. We compiled a database of 2,680 sulfur isotope analyses in the collagen of archaeological human and animal teeth from 221 individual locations across Western Europe. We used this isotopic compilation and remote sensing data to apply a multivariate machine-learning regression, and to predict sulfur isotope variations across Western Europe. The resulting model shows that sulfur isotope patterns are highly predictable, with 65\% of sulfur isotope variations explained using only 4 variables representing marine sulfate deposition and local geological conditions. We used this novel sulfur isoscape and existing strontium and oxygen isoscapes of Western Europe to apply triple isotopes continuous-surface probabilistic geographic assignments to assess the origin of a series of teeth from local animals and humans from Brittany. We accurately and precisely constrained the origin of these individuals to limited regions of Brittany. This approach is broadly transferable to studies in archaeology and paleoecology as illustrated in a companion paper (Colleter et al. 2021).},

In this article, we first review the rationale behind the cycling of Ca isotopes in vertebrate organisms. We then summarize and discuss the use of Ca isotopes as dietary tracers from trophic reconstructions in past vertebrate ecosystems to the tracking of early life dietary transitions. Next, we review and examine the research outcomes on the potential of Ca isotopes as biomarkers of bone loss in physiological and pathological conditions such as bone cancers and osteoporosis. While emphasizing the needs of future research in each of these applications, we suggest new potential uses of Ca isotopes in vertebrate biology. Finally, we identify challenges and barriers faced when developing such interdisciplinary projects and suggest how these can be overcome.},

	abstract = {Life-history theory predicts that increased investment in traits related to reproduction will be associated with a reduced ability to invest in survival or longevity. One mechanistic explanation for this trade-off is that metabolic stress generated from current fitness activities (e.g. reproduction or locomotion) will increase somatic damage, leading to reduced longevity. Yet, there has been limited support for this damage-based hypothesis. A possible explanation is that individuals can respond to increases in metabolic stress by plastically inducing cellular maintenance responses, which may increase, rather than decrease, longevity. We tested this possibility by experimentally manipulating investment in flight activity (a metabolic stressor) in the migratory monarch butterfly (
              Danaus plexippus
              ), a species whose reproductive fitness is dependent on survival through a period of metabolically intensive migratory flight. Consistent with the idea that metabolic stress stimulated investment in self-maintenance, increased flight activity enhanced monarch butterfly longevity and somatic tissue antioxidant capacity, likely at a cost to reproductive investment. Our study implicates a role for metabolic stress as a driver of life-history plasticity and supports a model where current engagement in metabolically stressful activities promotes somatic survival by stimulating investment in self-maintenance processes.},

	abstract = {Although variation in effect sizes and predicted values among studies of similar phenomena is inevitable, such variation far exceeds what might be produced by sampling error alone. One possible explanation for variation among results is differences among researchers in the decisions they make regarding statistical analyses. A growing array of studies has explored this analytical variability in different (mostly social science) fields, and has found substantial variability among results, despite analysts having the same data and research question. We implemented an analogous study in ecology and evolutionary biology, fields in which there have been no empirical exploration of the variation in effect sizes or model predictions generated by the analytical decisions of different researchers. We used two unpublished datasets, one from evolutionary ecology (blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, to compare sibling number and nestling growth) and one from conservation ecology (Eucalyptus, to compare grass cover and tree seedling recruitment), and the project leaders recruited 174 analyst teams, comprising 246 analysts, to investigate the answers to prespecified research questions. Analyses conducted by these teams yielded 141 usable effects for the blue tit dataset, and 85 usable effects for the Eucalyptus dataset. We found substantial heterogeneity among results for both datasets, although the patterns of variation differed between them. For the blue tit analyses, the average effect was convincingly negative, with less growth for nestlings living with more siblings, but there was near continuous variation in effect size from large negative effects to effects near zero, and even effects crossing the traditional threshold of statistical significance in the opposite direction. In contrast, the average relationship between grass cover and Eucalyptus seedling number was only slightly negative and not convincingly different from zero, and most effects ranged from weakly negative to weakly positive, with about a third of effects crossing the traditional threshold of significance in one direction or the other. However, there were also several striking outliers in the Eucalyptus dataset, with effects far from zero. For both datasets, we found substantial variation in the variable selection and random effects structures among analyses, as well as in the ratings of the analytical methods by peer reviewers, but we found no strong relationship between any of these and deviation from the meta-analytic mean. In other words, analyses with results that were far from the mean were no more or less likely to have dissimilar variable sets, use random effects in their models, or receive poor peer reviews than those analyses that found results that were close to the mean. The existence of substantial variability among analysis outcomes raises important questions about how ecologists and evolutionary biologists should interpret published results, and how they should conduct analyses in the future.},

	abstract = {Pathogen spillover between different host species is the trigger for many infectious disease outbreaks and emergence events, and ecosystem boundary areas have been suggested as spatial hotspots of spillover. This hypothesis is largely based on suspected higher rates of zoonotic disease spillover and emergence in fragmented landscapes and other areas where humans live in close vicinity to wildlife. For example, Ebola virus outbreaks have been linked to contacts between humans and infected wildlife at the rural-forest border, and spillover of yellow fever via mosquito vectors happens at the interface between forest and human settlements. Because spillover involves complex interactions between multiple species and is difficult to observe directly, empirical studies are scarce, particularly those that quantify underlying mechanisms. In this review, we identify and explore potential ecological mechanisms affecting spillover of pathogens (and parasites in general) at ecosystem boundaries. We borrow the concept of ‘permeability’ from animal movement ecology as a measure of the likelihood that hosts and parasites are present in an ecosystem boundary region. We then discuss how different mechanisms operating at the levels of organisms and ecosystems might affect permeability and spillover. This review is a step towards developing a general theory of cross-species parasite spillover across ecosystem boundaries with the eventual aim of improving predictions of spillover risk in heterogeneous landscapes.

The farthest estimated distance a monarch travelled in a single day was 143 km at a wind-assisted groundspeed of 31 km h−1 (8.7 m s−1) and the farthest estimated distance a green darner travelled in a single day was 122 km with a wind-assisted groundspeed of up to 77 km h−1 (21.5 m s−1). For both species, increased temperature and wind assistance positively influenced the pace of migration, but there was no effect of precipitation. While limitations to tracking such small animals remain, our approach and results represent a fundamental advance in understanding the natural history of insect migration and environmental factors that govern their movements.},

	abstract = {Fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and water between ecosystem components and organisms have great impacts across levels of biological organization. Although much progress has been made in tracing carbon and nitrogen, difficulty remains in tracing water sources from the ecosystem to animals and among animals (the ‘‘water web’’). Naturally occurring, nonradioactive isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen in water provide a potential method for tracing water sources. However, using this approach for terrestrial animals is complicated by a change in water isotopes within the body due to differences in activity of heavy and light isotopes during cuticular and transpiratory water losses. Here we present a technique to use stable water isotopes to estimate the mean mix of water sources in a population by sampling a group of sympatric animals over time. Strong correlations between H and O isotopes in the body water of animals collected over time provide linear patterns of enrichment that can be used to predict a mean mix of water sources useful in standard mixing models to determine relative source contribution. Multiple temperature and humidity treatment levels do not greatly alter these relationships, thus having little effect on our ability to estimate this population-level mix of water sources. We show evidence for the validity of using multiple samples of animal body water, collected across time, to estimate the isotopic mix of water sources in a population and more accurately trace water sources. The ability to use isotopes to document patterns of animal water use should be a great asset to biologists globally, especially those studying drylands, droughts, streamside areas, irrigated landscapes, and the effects of climate change.},

Major infestations occurred later in the year several hundred kilometers away in other cotton production areas in Texas and Oklahoma, but information is lacking to connect regional infestations by these migratory pests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of WSR-88D Doppler weather radar in locating and monitoring pest emigration from severely infested areas. Maximum radar reﬂectivity identiﬁed possible source areas in the vicinity of major infestations in cotton by beet armyworms and cabbage loopers that had been reported in Willacy County, TX. Areas of maximum clear-air radar reﬂectivity 13.5–16.5 dBZ) appeared approximately 0.5 h after sunset and displaced downwind toward susceptible cotton production regions in the Winter Garden and Southern Rolling Plains of west-central TX. Our results suggest that WSR-88D weather radar data may be useful in the development of crop pest advisories that estimate the timing, intensity, and displacement of insect migration ﬂights, especially with recent enhancements in timely public access to WSR-88D radar data and radar data processing and analysis software.},

In contrast, the ampliﬁcation effect hypothesis suggests that higher vector diversity may result in greater disease transmission by increasing and diversifying the transmission pathways. The relationship between vector diversity and pathogen transmission remains unclear and requires further study. Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease most prevalent in Brazil and transmitted by multiple species of insect vectors of the subfamily Triatominae, yet the drivers of spatial variation in its impact on human populations remain unresolved. We tested whether triatomine species richness, latitude, bioclimatic variables, human host population density, and socioeconomic variables predict Chagas disease mortality rates across over 5000 spatial grid cells covering all of Brazil. Results show that species richness of triatomine vectors is a good predictor of mortality rates caused by Chagas disease, which supports the ampliﬁcation effect hypothesis. Vector richness and the impact of Chagas disease may also be driven by latitudinal components of climate and human socioeconomic factors. We provide evidence that vector diversity is a strong predictor of disease prevalence and give support to the ampliﬁcation effect hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Animals that engage in long-distance seasonal migration experience strong selective pressures on their metabolic performance and life history, with potential consequences for molecular evolution. Species with slow life histories typically show lower rates of synonymous substitution (dS) than “fast” species. Previous research suggests long-distance seasonal migrants have a slower life history strategy than short-distance migrants, raising the possibility that rates of molecular evolution may covary with migration distance. Additionally, long-distance migrants may face strong selection on metabolically-important mitochondrial genes due to their long-distance flights. Using over 1,000 mitochondrial genomes, we assessed the relationship between migration distance and mitochondrial molecular evolution in 39 boreal-breeding migratory bird species. We show that migration distance correlates negatively with dS, suggesting that the slow life history associated with long-distance migration is reflected in rates of molecular evolution. Mitochondrial genes in every study species exhibited evidence of purifying selection, but the strength of selection was greater in short-distance migrants, contrary to our predictions. This result may indicate effects of selection for cold tolerance on mitochondrial evolution among species overwintering at high latitudes. Our study demonstrates that the pervasive correlation between life history and molecular evolutionary rates exists in the context of differential adaptations to seasonality.},

	abstract = {A range of different genetic architectures underpin local adaptation in nature. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) in the Eastern African Mountains harbor high frequencies of two chromosomal inversions that likely govern adaptation to this high-elevation habitat. In the Americas, honey bees are hybrids of European and African ancestries and adaptation to latitudinal variation in climate correlates with the proportion of these ancestries across the genome. It is unknown which, if either, of these forms of genetic variation governs adaptation in honey bees living at high elevations in the Americas. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of 29 honey bees from both high- and low-elevation populations in Colombia. Analysis of genetic ancestry indicated that both populations were predominantly of African ancestry, but the East African inversions were not detected. However, individuals in the higher elevation population had significantly higher proportions of European ancestry, likely reflecting local adaptation. Several genomic regions exhibited particularly high differentiation between highland and lowland bees, containing candidate loci for local adaptation. Genes that were highly differentiated between highland and low­ land populations were enriched for functions related to reproduction and sperm competition. Furthermore, variation in levels of European ancestry across the genome was correlated between populations of honey bees in the highland population and populations at higher latitudes in South America. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to both latitude and elevation in these hybrid honey bees are mediated by variation in ancestry at many loci across the genome.},

Inappropriate management policies of fish stocks have been applied as a consequence of inadequate characterization of subtle genetic structure in many fish species. In this study, we aim to assess the extent of genetic differentiation and structure of vendace (
              Coregonus albula
              ) collected from eight locations in the Bothnian Bay, the northernmost part of the Baltic Sea. Specifically, we test if this species forms a single panmictic population or is divided into several genetically distinct units. We used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to identify 21,792 SNPs based on 266 individuals. We identified a clear pattern of genetic differentiation between River Kalix and the other sampling locations, and a weak structuring between samples from Swedish and Finnish coast. Outlier analysis detected 41 SNPs putatively under divergent selection, mainly reflecting the divergence between River Kalix and the other samples. The outlier SNPs were located within or near 25 genes, including voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2 (CACNA2D2), cadherin 26 (CDH26) and carbonic anhydrase 4-like (CA4) that have earlier been associated with salt-tolerance and salinity stress. Our study provides the first genome-wide perspective on genetic structuring of Baltic Sea vendace and rejects the hypothesis of panmixia in the Bothnian Bay. As such, our work demonstrates the power of RAD-sequencing to detect low but significant genetic structuring relevant for fisheries management.},

                  Migrating grazers and carnivores respond to seasonal changes in the environment and often match peaks in resource abundance. However, it is unclear whether and how frugivorous animals use phenological events to time migration, especially in the tropics.
                
                
                  
                    The straw‐coloured fruit bat
                    Eidolon helvum
                    , Africa's most gregarious fruit bat, forms large seasonal colonies throughout much of sub‐Saharan Africa. We hypothesized that aggregations of
                    E. helvum
                    match the timing of their migration with phenologies of plant growth or precipitation.
                  
                
                
                  Using monthly colony counts from across much of the species' range, we matched peak colony size to landscape phenologies and explored the variation among colonies matching the overall closest phenological event.
                
                
                  
                    Peak colony size was closest to the peak instantaneous rate of green‐up, and sites with closer temporal matching were associated with higher maximum greenness, short growing season and larger peak colony size.
                    Eidolon helvum
                    seem to time their migrations to move into highly seasonal landscapes to exploit short‐lived explosions of food and may benefit from collective sensing to time migrations.
                  
                
                
                  The link between rapid changes in colony size and phenological match may also imply potential collective sensing of the environment. Overall decreasing bat numbers along with various threats might cause this property of large colonies to be lost.
                
                
                  Remote sensing data, although, indirectly linked to fruiting events, can potentially be used to globally describe and predict the migration of frugivorous species in a changing world.

Yet general principles describing how the dynamic nature of resources determine movement tactics are lacking [6]. We tested an emerging theory that predicts surﬁng and the existence of migratory behavior will be favored in environments where green-up is ﬂeeting and moves sequentially across large landscapes (i.e., wave-like green-up) [7]. Landscapes exhibiting wave-like patterns of greenup facilitated surﬁng and explained the existence of migratory behavior across 61 populations of four ungulate species on two continents (n = 1,696 individuals). At the species level, foraging beneﬁts were equivalent between tactics, suggesting that each movement tactic is ﬁne-tuned to local patterns of plant phenology. For decades, ecologists have sought to understand how animals move to select habitat, commonly deﬁning habitat as a set of static patches [8, 9]. Our ﬁndings indicate that animal movement tactics emerge as a function of the ﬂux of resources across space and time, underscoring the need to redeﬁne habitat to include its dynamic attributes. As global habitats continue to be modiﬁed by anthropogenic disturbance and climate change [10], our synthesis provides a generalizable framework to understand how animal movement will be inﬂuenced by altered patterns of resource phenology.},

            Tracking seasonally changing resources is regarded as a widespread proximate mechanism underpinning animal migration. Migrating herbivores, for example, are hypothesized to track seasonal foliage dynamics over large spatial scales. Previous investigations of this green wave hypothesis involved few species and limited geographical extent, and used conventional correlation that cannot disentangle alternative correlated effects. Here, we introduce stochastic simulations to test this hypothesis using 222 individual spring migration episodes of 14 populations of ten species of geese, swans and dabbling ducks throughout Europe, East Asia, and North America. We find that the green wave cannot be considered a ubiquitous driver of herbivorous waterfowl spring migration, as it explains observed migration patterns of only a few grazing populations in specific regions. We suggest that ecological barriers and particularly human disturbance likely constrain the capacity of herbivorous waterfowl to track the green wave in some regions, highlighting key challenges in conserving migratory birds.},

	abstract = {The painted lady butterfly Vanessa cardui is renowned for its virtually cosmopolitan distribution and the remarkable long-distance migrations that are part of its annual, multigenerational migratory cycle. In the autumn, V. cardui individuals are found north and south of the Sahara, suggesting distinct migratory behaviours within the species. However, the evolutionary and ecological factors shaping these differences in migratory behaviour remain largely unexplored. Here, we performed whole-genome resequencing and analysed the hydrogen and strontium isotopic signatures of 40 V. cardui individuals simultaneously collected in the autumn from regions both north and south of the Sahara. Our investigation revealed two main migratory groups: (i) short-distance migrants, journeying from temperate Europe to the circum-Mediterranean region and (ii) long-distance migrants, originating from temperate Europe, crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara, and reaching West Africa, covering a distance of up to over 4,000 km. Despite these stark differences in migration distance, a genome-wide analysis of 813,810 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that both short- and long-distance migrants belong to a single intercontinental panmictic population extending from northern Europe to sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to common biogeographic patterns, the Sahara is not a catalyst for population substructuring in this species. No significant genetic differentiation or signs of adaptation and selection were observed between the two migratory phenotypes (pairwise FST = 0.001 ± 0.006). Nonetheless, two individuals, belonging to the early arrivals to the Afrotropical region and covering longer migration distances, exhibited some genetic differentiation. The lack of genetic structure between short- and long-distance migrants suggests that migration distance in V. cardui is a plastic response to environmental conditions.},
