	abstract = {Migratory insects may move in large numbers, even surpassing migratory vertebrates in biomass. Long-distance migratory insects complete annual cycles through multiple generations, with each generation’s reproductive success linked to the resources available at different breeding grounds. Climatic anomalies in these grounds are presumed to trigger rapid population outbreaks. Here, we infer the origin and track the multigenerational path of a remarkable outbreak of painted lady (Vanessa cardui) butterﬂies that took place at an intercontinental scale in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa from March 2019 to November 2019. Using metabarcoding, we identiﬁed pollen transported by 264 butterﬂies captured in 10 countries over 7 months and modeled the distribution of the 398 plants detected. The analysis showed that swarms collected in Eastern Europe in early spring originated in Arabia and the Middle East, coinciding with a positive anomaly in vegetation growth in the region from November 2018 to April 2019. From there, the swarms advanced to Northern Europe during late spring, followed by an early reversal toward southwestern Europe in summer. The pollenbased evidence matched spatiotemporal abundance peaks revealed by citizen science, which also suggested an echo effect of the outbreak in West Africa during September–November. Our results show that population outbreaks in a part of species’ migratory ranges may disseminate demographic effects across multiple generations in a wide geographic area. This study represents an unprecedented effort to track a continuous multigenerational insect migration on an intercontinental scale.},
