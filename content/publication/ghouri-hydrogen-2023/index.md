abstract: 'Rationale: Many insect species undertake multi-generational migrations
  in the Afro-tropical and Palearctic ranges, and understanding their migratory connectivity
  remains challenging due to their small size, short life span and large population
  sizes. Hydrogen isotope (δ2H) can be used to reconstruct the movement of dispersing
  or migrating insects, but applying δ 2H for provenance requires a robust isotope
  baseline map (i.e., isoscape) for the Afro-Palearctic. 
  
  Methods: We analysed the
  δ2H in the wings ( δ2H wing) of 142 resident butterﬂies from 56 sites across the
  Afro-Palearctic. The δ2H wing values were compared to the predicted local growing-season
  precipitation δ2H values (δ2H GSP) using a linear regression model to develop
  an insect wing δ2H isoscape. We used multivariate linear mixed models and high-resolution
  and time-speciﬁc remote sensing climate and environmental data to explore the controls
  of the residual δ2H wing variability. 
 
  Results: A strong linear relationship was
  found between δ2H wing and δ2H GSP values (r2 = 0.53). The resulting isoscape showed
  strong patterns across the Palearctic but limited variation and high uncertainty
  for the Afro-tropics. Positive residuals of this relationship were correlated with
  dry conditions for the month preceding sampling whereas negative residuals were
  correlated with more wet days for the month preceding sampling. High intra-site
  δ2H wing variance was associated with lower relative humidity for the month preceding
  sampling and higher elevation. 
 
  Conclusion: The δ2H wing isoscape is applicable
  to trace butterﬂies, moths and other terrestrial herbivorous insects that migrate
  across the Afro-Palearctic range but has limited geolocation potential in the Afro-tropics.
  The spatial analysis of uncertainty using high-resolution climatic data demonstrated
  that many African regions with highly variable evaporation rates and relative humidity
  have δ2H wing values that are less related to δ2H GSP values. Increasing geolocation
  precision will require new modeling approaches using more time-speciﬁc environmental
  data and/or independent geolocation tools.'
