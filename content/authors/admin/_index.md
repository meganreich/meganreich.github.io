Megan Reich is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Ottawa. Her research interests include developing and applying techniques to track the long-range movements of animals, clarifying the genetic basis of migration, and exploring how environmental conditions influence migratory and dispersal behaviour. Her doctoral research focused on developing isotope-based geographic assignment to understand the migratory patterns and migratory connectivity of insects.
